# üß† Project Overview  

This dashboard visualizes key insights derived from a sentiment + rating prediction model trained on 5,000 Amazon Electronics reviews.  

While the full project includes a full-scale recommendation system (Retrieve ‚Üí Rank ‚Üí Explain), this Tableau dashboard focuses solely on two core areas:

- üîé Trust Indicators such as review helpfulness, verification status, and review length  
- üìâ Model Performance including predicted rating accuracy, MAE, confusion matrix, and key error analysis  

It is designed for e-commerce stakeholders, QA teams, and data product managers who want to:  
- Understand which reviews are trusted  
- Evaluate model reliability at scale  
- Reduce manual moderation time while improving review visibility and trustworthiness

# üè¢ Business Challenge  

On platforms like Amazon, millions of customer reviews pour in daily. However:

- ‚úÖ Not all reviews are verified purchases  
- üö´ Many short or generic reviews can mislead future buyers  
- üß† Review helpfulness is subjective and often difficult to automate  
- ‚ùå Sentiment or rating prediction models are often black boxes without interpretability  
- üìâ Misalignments between true vs. predicted ratings reduce trust in AI-powered recommendations  

This dashboard solves these challenges by:  
- Visualizing trust patterns across verified vs. unverified reviews  
- Breaking down model prediction errors and accuracy  
- Empowering QA teams with Top Errors Table and Confusion Matrix

# üéØ Dashboard Filters (Slicer Controls Used)

- ‚úÖ Review Text (search any phrase)  
- ‚úÖ Verified Purchased (Yes / No / All)  
- ‚úÖ Predicted Rating  
- ‚úÖ Overall Rating  
- ‚úÖ Helpful Votes slider  

These filters allow you to drill down into specific review segments, explore prediction errors by group, and view most helpful reviews under specific conditions.

- **Top Helpful Reviews Table**: Direct view of the most influential reviews (sorted by helpful vote count)  

## üìç Page 2: Model Performance  
- **Prediction Error Distribution**: Skewed right ‚Äì 2,000+ predictions have <1.0 star error, showing solid model alignment  
- **Rating Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes prediction reliability by star class  
- **Model Accuracy**: 36.2% (within 0.5 stars of actual), MAE = 1.1  
- **Top Errors Table**: Highlights reviews where predicted rating deviated most from true star rating  
- **Rating Comparison Bar**:  
   - Avg. Overall Rating: 4.19  
   - Avg. Predicted Rating: 4.16 ‚Üí Shows strong model consistency
