4,good and cheap,Had for about a month now. Still running strong and keeping my twc ultimate internet on all 8 of my houses devices.

5,Great keyboard.,"Love this keyboard.  Easy to type on and not to much bigger than the wireless keyboard I was using.  Best of all, though, I can easily see it.  Keys have a great 'feel' to them.

2,Not very well made,"When I saw this RCA charging dock, I jumped to get it. Normally, I work from home and use one or two plugs to keep all of my Apple items charged throughout the day (rotating them betwen plugs). When I saw this charging dock, I thought it would be a great way to connect my iphone, keep it upright for viewing ease, and keep the phone charged all day long. First, although the picture looks good, the item is cheaply made plastic, which I guess would normally be ok for something like this (although to me in the picture it looked a little sturdier). The 30 point connection does not work well. I had to rock my phone several times to get it start charging (it wasn't easy to see if it is connected properly). Having a charging light on the base would have been a nice-have, but of course there isn't one. I then tried my ipod in there. I found that a little easier to connect, but still takes several attempts of getting it to the right angle to make it work right. To be honest, I think it is just a matter of time before this breaks (given the difficulty I have in connecting). I would honestly say to spend your money elsewhere. This item is not worth the investment.",B005EWB3XW,B00XIUKJDW,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,49:11.0,0,FALSE,1170,4,2,4
4,"Great camera for the money - good, solid features","I want to begin by saying I own a Canon Rebel which I love and use all the time. I wanted to get a second camera which also took great pictures but that was lower priced and better for me to take on extended travel without all my lenses). The Fujifilm FinePix is a good camera. For around the $200 price range, you get a high quality camera with good picture taking quality (14 MP, EVF, 30 times zoom capability). It is easy to learn and use and makes an excellent entry level camera with high quality features (would make a great graduation gift for a high schooler to introduce them to a higher level of picture taking than a simple point and shoot). It is a little large and plasticy, but overall I do recommend it for a good second camera or, as I mentioned, to someone looking to enter the SLR market (but not ready to spend $600+).",B006TR0FCQ,B00A4QXIRM,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,20:52.0,3,FALSE,837,4.4,4,4
4,Probably great for a professional,"I was in the market for a new camera and when I saw this bag in the Vine program I thought I would snap it up. I did get my Canon Rebel (thanks Amazon!) and several lenses to boot (in preparation for my trip this month to Israel). Although the quality of the bag is good, the size to me is really inconvenient. First, it is shaped like a back pack, which makes it kind of big. I am not sure if I am going to be able to bring this on the plane with me (as the boarding guidelines state 1 carry-on and I have a purse and laptop I am bringing). In addition, there are straps and zippered compartments which are not really conveniently placed. It's not an easy bag to get your gear in and out of. I see this bag as a great tool to have if you are backpacking as you have a place to hang a tripod and there is a small storage area if you wanted to bring a snack with you. But for someone like me, who wants it for sightseeing/traveling, I think a more conventional camera bag would have done the trick better.",B0036AWR8E,B00BWH2SWI,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,41:49.0,0,FALSE,1004,4.3,4,4

5,kids tablet case,I purchased this for my 5 year old's Samsung Galaxy tablet... it fit perfectly.  He loves the handle and that he can fold it to a stand.  He was having trouble dropping it (No good for devices!) until he got the handle.  The case is a bit spongy too which gives it a little cushion.  All in all we think it's a win/win case!

5,a good option,"I really like these...  the flat wires DO help them not to tangle... Has a &#34;universal&#34; tip as most things do this day and age... worked with my brand new LG G4 cell, my old rotary dial IPOD and my Kindle 8&#34; HDX.  It comes with 4 (2 sets) of extra ear cushions.  I feel that I have smallerish ears and I have a hard time finding earpods that are comfortable and will stay in.  These work great.  Comfortable and they have stayed in.  Mind you, I am NOT jogging with them in.  I only wish they'd come with a zipper case to hold them in for convenience.  At the price point, you'd think they would.  It does also have a microphone and I have &#34;tested&#34; that... worked. It has a little attachable pinch clip to keep in place as you move around. The foam tips are sort of like memory foam, but almost a bit softer really.  I think this both helps them stay in AND retain comfort.  The sound is very clean and clear - for an adult anyway.  The tips are cornflower blue if that matters to anyone... I think the pic is very clear and representative. I will update if there are any issues.<br />UPDATE: 6/29/2015 I have used these earbuds a number of times... one of the issues I have had in the past is that this &#34;shape&#34; of earbud doesn't want to stay in my ear... (tiny ears?) but these DO stay in.. I think it's the type of foam tip... seems to grip a bit better? To be fair, again, I am not jogging with them in... I am mostly in a sitting position using them. The &#34;flat&#34; wires really do help them not get all tangled... having stay that.. they also resist &#34;wrapping&#34; a bit too.  This is probably good. Otherwise you'd break the wires inside. The kiss of death to any wired accessory. Also, I've been informed that these are going to start coming with carry cases!!  Yup.  That would make them 5 star in my humble opinion and I'm keeping them in my &#34;save&#34; pile for a possible second order.<br />UPDATE 7/26/2015... Still happy with my purchase.  I am informed by the seller that they are now including a case.  This makes it definitely a 5-star value and worthy of a purchase. Will update if there any use/wear issues to report",B008D76Q64,B008D76Q64,AFZUK3MTBIBEDQOPAK3OATUOUKLA,27:13.0,7,TRUE,2172,4.7,5,5

4,Works perfectly,"This is advertised as an ergonomic keyboard.  To me, ergonomic is a keyboard that is split into two slanted halves, like the Microsoft Natural Keyboard.  This is a flat keyboard.  In spite of that, the keys have a good feel and response.  I only have wired keyboards, so I got this so that I could have a wireless if I wanted to use one sometimes, as you are then not confined with a cord.  Requires 1 AA battery to operate (not included).  At first, I thought they forgot to include the wireless transmitter, but it comes hidden in the battery compartment.  This is okay, but there is no place to store it once the battery is installed.  Of course, if you are going to store the keyboard and not use it all the time, you wouldn't typically want to leave the battery in anyway.  If you want wireless, probably better to get a wireless mouse and keyboard together, as they would probably run off one transmitter, whereas with this keyboard if I want to add a wireless mouse later, it will involve using a second transmitter which would use another USB port.  The keyboard is going to be of limited use to me, as I currently use a KVM-switch that allows me to control up to 4 computers with one monitor, one mouse and one keyboard.  I would have to upgrade to a KVM switch that takes USB to use the keyboard on more than one computer.  This is truly plug and play and I had it operating in no time at all.  Seems like it is quality made and should last a while.  Made in China of course.",B09N7532L7,B09N7532L7,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,03:47.5,0,FALSE,1485,3.3,4,3
5,Very Small; Plug and Play,"The capacity of thumb drives keeps going up and the sizes keep going down.  They are so convenient for off-site backup.  This is probably about as small as is practical.  I think it is about the smallest flash drive I have seen.  About the size of a stick of Dentine gum.  This is not particularly high capacity by today's standards, but 8 GB is not that small either.  It's good for transporting a number of small files or a few larger ones or a backup of data if you don't have too much data.  Great for a key chain too, as it has a nice big loop on the end.  After I inserted it on a Windows 7 PC, it was up and ready to use in seconds.  On XP it wanted to reboot after it had been inserted, but I tried it without rebooting and it appeared to work fine.  Two minor issues with this drive.  It doesn't have a conventional USB plug.  Instead it looks like a little 3-contact connector.  At first I wondered how I would insert it into my USB port.  Believe me it does go in, but one problem I had was which direction to insert it.  It fits into one side of a USB connection in either direction.  In one direction it works of course and one it doesn't.  The other problem is that the connection hides under a little bendable rubber piece and my USB ports are recessed, so I couldn't bend the rubber enough to easily insert it.  If you want a very tiny storage unit that works great, this is for you.  I have always had excellent results with any Verbatim products too and I full trust their quality and reliability.",B007LLYB1U,B00BXK7LBC,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,24:00.0,1,FALSE,1515,4.2,5,4

5,An amazing e-Book reader with numerous extras.,"I received a Kindle 2 as a gift recently. I'd had my eye on the Kindle since its launch, but couldn't justify the high price tag. I use several forms of portable technology including an HTC touchscreen smartphone, but the Kindle 2 was my first eBook reader. Opening the Kindle 2 was an experience: Amazon has cleverly packaged the Kindle in minimally wasteful packaging; the box itself is very clever and space-saving, and the USB cord is tucked into the two-prong adapter (so if, like me, you initially think that they forgot to include the USB cable, just pop the prong adapter off the end).<br /><br />First, the size: the Kindle 2 measures about 8 inches by 5 inches by .36 (it's literally thinner than a Number 2 pencil), so it's about the same size as a paperback without the thickness (or the weight). It weighs only 10.2 ounces, so it's easy to slide it into a large purse or backpack. The display is large and crystal clear, but is only in black and white, so if you're getting magazine or newspaper subscriptions, be aware. There are sixteen shades of grey, though, so photos and illustrations have a lot of depth and contrast despite being in black and white. There are six different text sizes available if you have problems with too-small fonts, but the Kindle screen isn't backlit, so this won't work in low light without a reading light. There's also the controversial text-to-speech feature, which is the same technology that's come with Windows OS for years; a synthesized voice (male or female) will ""read"" the text out loud (there's a 3.5mm headphone jack if you want to listen in private). After the Authors' Guilld threatened to sue Amazon.com over the feature, publishers have the right to disable it on Kindle versions, so be aware that the text-to-speech feature may not work on all Kindle books.<br /><br />You can purchase and download Kindle books instantly using the Kindle 2's free Whispernet (an EVDO modem with fallback to 1xRTT that uses's Sprint's 3G network). Most New York Times Bestsellers are available in Kindle editions, which are typically $9.99. There are no Kindle rentals; once you've downloaded the book, it's yours. However, there are numerous free Kindle books to be found on Amazon.com and elsewhere; simply click on the Kindle Books tab at Amazon.com and set to sort by price ($0.00 titles show up first). Many of the free Kindle texts are based on older (think 19th-century) authors and are transcribed by volunteers, so they may not be exactly what you were expecting. You can either purchase Kindle books from your PC and have them sent wirelessly to your Kindle, or you can browse and purchase directly from the Kindle, but be careful: Kindle books are purchased via 1-click, which means that you could accidentally purchase something you'd only intended to look at. The download time depends on the size of the book; for a text-only book, it took less than a minute to download. When  I downloaded a larger book with illustrations, it took several minutes.<br /><br />Reading on the Kindle is much like reading a paperback; the Kindle ""disappears"" as you read. However, the page turning is a bit jarring, since every time you turn a page, the screen flashes in contrast (at first I thought that it was some sort of flaw or bug). The previous page button is on the left edge, while there's a next page button on both sides of the Kindle, so page turning is easy (other than the screen flashing). On the downside, you can't flip several pages ahead easily without repeatedly clicking the ""next"" button. With a real paperback, you'd simply thumb through the pages.<br /><br />There is no expandable memory slot, but the Kindle 2 features 2GB (1.4 GB for user content) of internal memory that will hold up to 1,500 books as well as documents (PDF, HTML, DOC, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP through conversion) and MP3 music and AAX Audible audiobook files. You can even set up customized MP3 music playlists (it's under ""experimental"") by dragging files into the ""Music"" folder on the Kindle by hooking it up to your PC via the included USB 2.0 cable. If you have documents that are in another format (the Kindle native format is .AZW), you have two choices for conversion: either e-mail the documents to your Kindle e-mail (your regular e-mail ended with @kindle.com) for a ten-cent conversion charge (you'll be billed when your conversion balance reaches $3.00) or to your email @free.kindle.com (you then must drag-and-drop the file onto your Kindle from your PC, but there's no fee to convert the file).<br /><br />The Kindle also features a basic Web browser that handles text-only versions fairly well, and a built-in dictionary. You're able to highlight, put in page markers and add notes to Kindle books, making it a useful tool for study or research. There's a full QWERTY keyboard and a five-way toggle that takes some getting used to. The menu designs are drop down similar to Windows; you simply move through the various options using the five-way controller, then press down on it to select.<br /><br />The battery can hold a charge for up to four days with the Whispernet on; you'll get a much longer charge if you turn it off. It takes about three hours to fully charge the battery, but it's not user-replaceable; you have to mail your Kindle to Amazon.com for a replacement. The battery is covered for the first year after purchase, but it's $59 after that. The Kindle 2 also doesn't come with [[ASIN:B001JAH7OM Amazon Kindle 2 Leather Cover]], for which you'll have to shell out extra money unless you choose to store it in the box.<br /><br />If you love new technology and are looking for new ways to read / listen on the go, the Kindle 2 may be a good choice for you. But besides the initial expense, the Kindle versions of paperbacks are as expensive as their paper counterparts. Depending on your area, the Whispernet may not have a strong signal (and for now, the Kindle 2 is only available in the US, so overseas customers will have to wait). I love mine, but it's up to you whether it's worth the cost of the Kindle 2 and book downloads.",B00154JDAI,B00154JDAI,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,09:55.0,2,FALSE,6100,5,5,5

4,Not What I Expected,"This film scanner was not what I expected and that's all my fault. I thought it was for scanning and converting negatives and slides. And that's what it is, but I don't have the right kind of negatives and slides. From what I can tell, it's for the film that goes in the Brownie cameras. I just assumed that the old slides that belonged to my Dad and to my inlaws, would work, but their cameras must have been 35 mm. We did give it a try with some negatives that were from 1990's and we could see how it worked. It does require batteries. The whole system is pretty simple. An iPhone would probably work really well with this. My husband and I both have Google Pixel 6 cameras and the camera doesn't line up with this as well as other phone cameras. I have a couple of slide scanners and I was thrilled with the idea of being able to convert them digitally to my phone instead of having to use an SD card and uploading that to my computer.

My husband while assisted by our daughter completed the whole thing in less than an hour. Prior to the installation, we had ordered an install kit for the car model. This unit works very well with Apple Play! It basically displays your phone on it so your phone on it. So you use the touch screen method to access your music, driving maps, etc. It comes with a microphone for phone calls. They installed it near the ignition, but the quality of calls isn't that good. The next time our daughter comes home from college, they're going to try it somewhere else. Overall, our daughter is very happy with it.

There's a slot for an SD card, but it uses large SD cards which aren't as common anymore, so we didn't have any. It does allow for a flash drive to be inserted, so that's how we are using it. The picture quality is pretty good. We have been using high resolution pictures on it, so if you use lower resolution ones, it may not look as nice.

That's not really a flaw in these specifically, I usually have this issue with all ear buds. Overall, I think these are pretty good, especially at this price point, but I will probably stick with over the ear style headphones for comfort.",B00VV6X1UI,B00VV6X1UI,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,30:44.2,1,FALSE,682,4.8,4,5

Although my old bulb didn't burn out or pop, I got a warning message from the projector that the lamp lifetime was up.  And what a difference a new lamp makes. The new lamp was brighter the color accuracy was much improved compared to the old lamp I replaced.  Apparently these lamps lose their brightness and ability to provide true white over time.  The picture looked as good as when I first used my projector brand new.  It's better to buy the bulb with the housing such as this product rather than just the bulb alone.  There's significant precision in the design of projector bulbs and their housing.  The less you handle it the better. A drop-in replacement is the way to go. Strong burning smell at first which disappeared after the first day of use.

5,Amazing,"These are without doubt the best headphones I've ever owned.  The sound quality is incredible- rich and full without over-emphasizing any part of the sound spectrum.  Bass is amazing and brain scrambling.  Mid range is clear and precise and not at all obscured by the lower and upper registers.  Highs are crisp and clear.<br />When I put them on for the first time, the fit was comfortable.  They are very good at blocking outside sounds.  The first music I found on my IPod that I wanted to hear was Dvorak's 9th Symphony.  Wonderful.  Instruments were distinct and clear.  Horns sounded rich and full.  A little Springsteen and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper confirmed that these phones will handle a broad range of musical styles.  Sgt. Pepper was the album that made an audiophile of me back in the 60's when it was released.  At that time, I had a cheap portable stereo with a tilt out turntable and fold out speakers.  I wore out Sgt Pepper on that thing, and then, a friend happened to have it playing on his parents' high end Marantz receiver and impressive speakers when I stopped by one day.  I heard things from that music on his system that I had never heard on my cheap stereo, and I was hooked.  These phones at less than  a hundred dollars give me everything I heard on that high end system all those years ago.  I've seen headphones listing for a hell of a lot more, and I can't imagine that they can sound that much better than these Sony's to justify spending several times more for them.

These work off a dongle (a small radio receiver that you plug into a USB 2.0 port at the back of the monitor) when the mouse is turned on. The dongle is stored inside the mouse’s battery compartment.  Both keyboard and mouse are sensitive, and I actually like the feel of the keyboard better than the feel of a very nice Verbatim quiet-key keyboard (with mouse) that I own that also works from a radio dongle.<br /><br />The keyboard does have square, flat keys that aren’t at all elegant-looking.  However, if you’re used to typing on an iPad’s virtual keyboard or on a laptop, you won’t mind the flat keys.  The dongle eliminates two cables (one for the keyboard, one for the mouse), so you can move both mouse and keyboard off your desk if you aren’t using the PC.<br /><br />DISPLAY:  Not being an expert on technical display specs, all I can say is that the display has accurate color and excellent high-definition images.  The size of the display (23.8”) is perfect for a PC that lives on your desk (where you’re always sitting close to it).  Also, the edge-to-edge display makes this look like an expensive monitor!<br /><br />OPERATING SYSTEM, CAMERA, JACKS AND PORTS:  Windows 10 Home is powerful enough, and full-featured enough, for my general home use.  I use this PC for checking mail, connecting to the Internet, playing a few simple games (e.g., Microsoft Solitaire), occasionally meeting with people via Skype, keeping financial records, and composing a few letters.  The system comes with free online Microsoft Word, and with a 1-month free trial of Microsoft Office 365 ($99 a year if you keep it).<br /><br />Wireless is built in.  My PC had no difficulty connecting to my home network--connections are handled by the Win10 operating system.  Stereo sound is built in, and sounds good to my non-audiophile ears.<br /><br />The webcam is kind of pathetic, with very poor picture quality.  However, people are recognizable, and you can easily replace the webcam with a better one. The webcam  isn’t built-in, but attaches magnetically to the monitor and plugs into a USB port in back.<br /><br />On the back of the monitor, the PC has an SD card reader, an audio jack (for headphones, and I think microphone too), a Kensington lock, an ethernet port, a PS2 port, a VGA port, an HDMI/DP port, and four USB ports (two 2.0 ports, with one being used by the dongle; and two 3.0 ports, with one being used by the webcam).  If four USB ports aren’t enough for you, you can easily use one or more of the USB ports to add USB-port hubs.<br /><br />STORAGE:  The hard drive (inside the monitor) has a 1 terabyte capacity, which will store tons of photos and doc files.  If you need more storage, you can add a USB storage drive.<br /><br />SUMMARY:  This is an extremely well-thought-out general purpose PC.  It’s a space-saver, and it’s extraordinarily easy to set up.  The only hard thing is understanding that the keyboard and mouse work by radio, and locating the receiver dongle inside the mouse.",B07CY79CKZ,B07CY79CKZ,AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q,28:58.3,195,FALSE,3784,4.3,5,4
4,"A Heftier, More ""Substantial"" Stylus","Capacitive styluses are not all alike.  Besides color, there are subtle differences in sensitivity, length, barrel size, weight, and attachment clips or lanyards.  This Targus stylus, which is 4.75"" long (exclusive of the capacitive tip) is quite a good one, in terms of sensitivity.  Screens slide with minimal pressure, and selections register with only a light touch or tap.<br /><br />Compared to other styluses that I tested, the Targus stylus is the longest, has the widest barrel, and is the heaviest.  The weight makes it tiring for me to use, but some individuals (men, perhaps?) may prefer a heftier, more ""substantial"" stylus like this one.  Because of the wider barrel, the tip is also wider, which makes it slightly less accurate for selecting small targets (e.g., links displayed in web browsers in tiny fonts).  The extra length is a plus, if you hold a stylus like a pointer (away from the tip), rather than like a pencil (close to the tip).<br /><br />This stylus has both a pocket clip and a metal attachment ""loop"" (for attaching to a lanyard or keychain).  I purchased mine at a local office supplies store.  Besides this stylus, I tested the [[ASIN:B005O2URES MiniSuit Universal Capacitive Stylus Pen]], the [[ASIN:B0008G3ID2 BoxWave Capacitive Kindle Fire Stylus]], and the [[ASIN:B004GCJEZU AmazonBasics Stylus for Touchscreen Devices]].  My favorite is the AmazonBasics Stylus, because of its 4.25 "" length, slim barrel, light weight, and excellent sensitivity.  I rate this stylus at 4 stars (""I like it"") rather than 5 stars (""I love it""), because I like the AmazonBasics stylus slightly better.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, as I was, what a ""capacitive"" stylus is, it is a human interface device (e.g., a mouse) that uses ""capacitive sensing"" to measure changes of position on a touchscreen.  It works just like a human finger on a touchscreen device, and you can often get more accurate navigation using a stylus.  Wikipedia has good articles on capacitive sensing and capacitive devices.",B004JU1MNG,B07G98G3BV,AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q,04:26.0,2,FALSE,2024,2.1,4,2

5,Excellent laptop bag with room for expansion; fits my 14” laptop with room to spare,"This laptop bag is very nice. In fact I am impressed. It comes with a carry strap that can be hooked on the diagonal on the bag. It also has handles. The handle covers are not great but they are good enough. In fact, I wish the handle covers were made of the same material as the interior of the laptop pocket because that would have been better. This is the only thing I do not like about this bag.<br /><br />FEATURES<br />- One outside folder pocket by the ZINZ label<br /><br />- On the opposite side, there is another folder pocket by the handle and one zippered pocket underneath the horizontal strap<br /><br />- The main compartment has a Velcro strap over the folder pocket that is padded. This is where the laptop goes.<br /><br />- Besides the thin central compartment that will hold a couple of folders or some papers, there are four folder-type pockets of various sizes and one tiny folder-type pocket that will hold a pen or pencil.<br /><br />- If more room is needed, there is an expanded section that can be unzipped and which has a lot of room (three to four inches of capacity). Inside that expanded compartment are small mesh folder pockets (two on one side and three on the other).<br /><br />In summary, this is a great laptop bag. It is well made and the zippers open and close easily. The laptop sleeve is softly padded and protective. The bag's worst feature is the plasticky or PU leather-like handle covers. That is the only thing I do not like as the handles are not as comfortable to carry for a long time as they could be. Although there is no current price listed, I would expect this to be priced between $25 and $30.",B08SQ2XXX8,B08SQ2XXX8,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,00:23.3,1,FALSE,1649,4.3,5,4

1,"This fan heats up my laptop because the fan is reversed, temperature is only displayed in Celsius, & instructions are horrendous","I selected this because my work computer runs hot and this fan is supposed to cool down a laptop by attaching it to the vent. I tried this on a Dell Latitude E6430 and the LED temperature reading climbs and my laptop heats up when connected. In fact, there's nothing about this product that would make me recommend it. Read on to see what is provided and what about this product is so wrong.<br /><br />WHAT COMES IN THE PACKAGE:<br />- 1 laptop cooler fan<br />- 1 USB cable<br />- 1 plastic connector plate<br />- 4 rubber sticky feet and 3 (not 4 as specified) tiny silicone suction cups<br />- 1 instruction sheet<br />- 4 silicon mouthpieces to connect the fan to the laptop vent<br /><br />WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PRODUCT:<br /><br />- The instructions (picture attached) are incredibly poor and barely make any sense at all.  Here are three sentences that I copied below exactly as written including punctuation and wording (except for the quotes I put around those sentences to indicate they were verbatim).<br /><br />&#34;Products with a bottom bracket accessories, and comes with three super sucker.&#34;<br />&#34;Qingtai outlet end notebook, the silicone radiator outlet to trap the notebooks vents guide.&#34;<br />&#34;According to the books of the heat, free adjustment&#34;<br /><br />- Assembly is slightly required and I had to figure it out on my own because the instructions were so poor.<br /><br />* To assemble, I took the plastic black connector plate and snapped that into the three holes on the bottom front of the unit; the side closest to the on / off knob.<br /><br />* I inserted the suction cups into the three holes in the front of the plate with the suction cups side down. Perhaps I could have used the rubber sticky feet but I'm not sure where to put those. I think the installation of those cushions is optional and I suspect they go either on the bottom of the connector plate or the unit.<br /><br />* I attached one of the four silicone &#34;mouth guards&#34; to the front of the unit. I was sure to use the one that best fit the shape of the laptop vent so that it created a tight seal. Once assembled, I plugged one end of the USB cable into the side of the unit and the other end to a free USB port on my laptop.<br /><br />* After the USB was connected, the temperature is displayed without ever having to turn on the unit or connect it to a laptop.  I noted that the temperature without connecting the fan to my vent and with the fan off read 26.0 C. The LED is only in Celsius so I had to convert the numbers to Fahrenheit because I am not fluent in Celsius.  I do know that the temperature is supposed to go down and not up so I turned on the fan but still did not connect the fan to my vent and the temperature started decreasing to 24.0 C and lower. However, once I connected the fan to the vent the temperature steadily increased to 31, 33, 36, 36.5 C, etc. I repeated all these steps on six separate occasions and got the same results. In exasperation, I decided to turn the unit around by facing the back of the unit toward the laptop vent. Once I did this, the temperature decreased slightly. This means that the fan is rotating the wrong way making this device useless.<br /><br />In summary, this fan heats up the laptop. I suspect the reason for this is because the fan is rotating the wrong way so it is not drawing the heat away from the laptop vent. The temperature LED is only in Celsius which is great for Europeans fluent in that temperature but is not great for the majority of Americans. Also, the instructions are horrendous. My recommendation is to pass on this one.<br /><br />UPDATE Jan 24, 2017 - I tried to see if I could fix this fan but could not. There are three tiny screws holding the body together. One screw is located underneath one of the rubber feet. Once I got it open, I had no way of knowing if the connectors are correct or not. The ribbons inside only go one way and reversing the fan doesn't seem to be an option. Therefore, I decided to throw the unit out since Vine reviewers have no warranty on the products they receive.

5,Wow! This equals parent of the year award..!!,"Ordered this for my son and his 17th birthday!! Chose this specifically because of the subwoofers and boy, you would’ve thought we had purchased an entire home stereo system… He was over the moon happiest with this gift- and mind you, he also received a new PS4 gaming station!!<br /><br />I was apprehensive how well the sub would sound in a small Bluetooth speaker and truly, it suits the needs we have perfectly. Those needs being… “I’m 17 with a few friends over (ha! Must remember we’re in the middle of COVID-19..!!) and we want to turn up music in my room, take the music to the pool… Or, just tell people we have our very own subwoofer! Sad but true, it’s all about bragging rights at this age… If this is any indication of the coolness factor, I’ve had two parents contact me asking what exactly was purchased to make us the coolest parents of the year!! That is The best endorsement I need.<br />As for functionality, I’m impressed the sound quality can turn an adequate size living room into a rave, mosh pit, country jamboree… Whatever your poison is- this speaker does not distort at the higher volume, which I was concerned about. The fact the music of choice happens to be mostly rap is another story… but, that is not the speakers fault it’s my sons poor taste in music!<br />As you can tell I am not a stereo guru or techie nope! Not in any capacity… I do know you can enter an SD card which was pretty impressive to the kids… I know they can lay tracks if that makes anyone feel better? Personally, I just made certain that had nothing to do with using drugs- and when I was assured it clearly wasn’t… I let them do their thing!<br />Great idea I want to toss out… We also chose a Bluetooth microphone that runs about the same price as the speaker- And.. as the kids listen to music they can karaoke of sorts… Using a lot of fun features the microphone has (Voice distortion, echo, voice enhancing.. truly the ability to make anyone sound better than they do!) I mention this because, together these two items have created such a fun source of entertainment for the small crowd… And during the quarantine I will take it all day long!<br />At night- my son plugs in the speaker so it’s fully charged and they have used it for a few hours at a time without any issue a battery‘s dying… Note, if next to an outlet you could also keep speaker plugged in and use it just the same. Technically, if plugged in this could run 24/7- but, not sure you want to torture yourself that way!?<br />I will admit, this does remind me a little bit of my old high school days in the 80’s.. when we would carry around a “boom box” on our shoulder- yep! You never knew when you needed to have a break dancing riff-off..!! The only thing different is, this Bluetooth speaker is half the size! Looks the same but a mini me version..<br />If looking for something to listen to that produces decent sound quality and definitely gets a throaty base this is it! Kids will appreciate it parents be warned-<br />I hope this info helps.. feel free to let me know!",B086STGJ49,B0BR89N1H7,AEIPJBAN7A55Q5DFFPZSR2UV3OKA,11:11.8,0,FALSE,3051,5.1,5,5

5,Great cover for price!,After much research I purchased this tablet cover for my husband. I usually purchase more expensive padded phone and tablet covers but they are so expensive. This cover seems protective and he likes the flap that bends that you can use to prop up the tablet. Also he likes the way the flap has a magnet that easily shuts the cover and shuts the screen off when closed and turns on when opened. The case has a spot that holds the stylus which is secure both when the case is open and closed. I got the blue and it looks nice. Great purchase for the price!

4,"Judging Price vs. Performance, A Decent Kid/Camping-Proof Camera","To let you know where I am coming from on this review, I have two sons, 9 and 4. We do a lot of camping without mom, but want to share our adventures.  So far, our trips have destroyed a Canon Powershot 450 (overly hydrated while canoeing) and a Powershot 980IS (smashed into ground during a fall.)  So the idea of a waterproof, shockproof and hopefully kid-proof camera sounded perfect.<br /><br />Purpose for camera: Rugged camera to take along canoeing, fishing, camping, and hiking for snapshots and quick, shareable movies.<br /><br />I have never owned a camera in this class, and the one thing I am trying to keep in mind is the price point.  This is not intended to be a high-end performance device, but more a rugged snapshot camera.  I was a little suspect on 1080P on a hand held device under $175 (still am,) but the 5 MP camera is adequate for photos to email to grandparents and to show off our catches and camps to mom.<br /><br />Design -<br /><br />The camera is very nicely designed.  It is physically attractive and comfortable in the hand.  The winged doors lock into place well in their watertight positions and are, well kind of cool. The screen is adequate for playback and we spend a lot of time watching what we filmed over and over.  The controls are spare, but easy to understand and operate.  The four major flaws I found are; the embedded battery, lack of a flash, lack of lens cover, and no headphone jack for previewing sound.<br /><br />Battery-<br /><br />It is unfortunate that the design team decided to go with an internal non-removable battery.  This seems to move the device into the ""disposable"" class since it is useless once the battery dies.  I suspect that the battery can be replaced fairly easily, judging by the hex screws in the camera body, but there is a big difference between slipping a battery in and out and sending the camera out for replacement.  Also, I can make a huge argument for being able to carry a back up battery.  At least for now though, the battery seems to have a decent charge.  We have filmed and played back films for at least two hours between recharges and have never seen the battery near empty.<br /><br />Performance -<br /><br />Image capture: 1080p is a lot to ask from such a small sensor. For that matter, so is 720p.  So I am satisfied with the images I am getting, not great but what I would expect.  I usually shoot Canon DSLR's (except when camping with kids) so I am at times frustrated by the lack of manual controls of any kind.  Autofocus, autoexposure... with no way to change anything beyond file format and resolution.  The images and video I am getting are a little noisy and especially so in low light. Blurring from camera or subject motion is common on stills. This is where the flash option would be nice.  But in daylight, or decently lit interior shots the images are definitely passable.  Again, judging this camera on its price point and function, it really is decent.  If I want good stills, I'll go with a Canon 50D, if I want a snapshot of my kid pulling a bass into the canoe, this is perfect.<br /><br />I am uploading a video with more details on picture and movie quality.<br /><br />Sound: For a single source mike on the camera, it does pretty good.  Definitely picks up footsteps or breathing, so don't film while walking up hill.  Truly emphasizes if you are out of shape.  Picks up ambient sound well and in tests in a light breeze, did fine.<br /><br />Interface:  I had the interface lock up on me once and I was unable to get it to power off or get out of a locked state.  I had to use the small reset button to get it to reboot and clear the freeze.  So I have thrown a very small paper clip in its case.  Without being able to pull the battery, the reset button seems to have been the only option.  Otherwise the device is very fast loading up, and the interface is intuitive and easy to use. Although occasionally when browsing I end up in fast forward or reverse when watching a movie and it takes a little to get it back to play or browse.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />All in all, I am really happy with this camera.  It is full of limitations which you should understand before purchase.  For the price, it is a decent camera and it fits our intended purpose to a Tee.  My kids love the ability to take a movie, then watch it immediately.  I like the feeling that it might survive the kids for a while.  I feel like I'm being pretty critical of the camera, and I guess I am.  But I'm giving it four stars because it does what I want it to, and after using it for a couple weeks, I really like it.  Just don't expect the world from a inexpensive camera.<br /><br />Pros-<br />Price (under $175 is not a high end price)<br />Images are decent (under daylight or bright light conditions)<br />Kidproof<br />Quick to startup<br />Well thought-out design<br />Just all round cute and useful<br /><br />Cons (in order of importance to me)<br />Internal Battery (cannot be replaced, nor can you carry a spare)<br />No Flash (can't stop motion blur, fill flash)<br />Low-light performance (weak performance, noisy video and stills)<br />Complete lack of manual controls<br />Occasional lock-ups on interface<br />No Head phones for reviewing movies<br />When switching through modes it keeps defaulting to zoomed out",B004FLL5BI,B004I1KJ8U,AGLQQCIS5V6EGUCS5SSNHWZHQM6Q,45:30.0,3,FALSE,5331,3.6,4,4

2,Good construction EXCEPT for backpack straps: extremely UNCOMFORTABLE!,"First and foremost, I need a convertible backpack which allows for transport -  all materials needed for the long days on campus (grad student).  In addition, I need the professional aspect to function as a briefcase. Solely on those points, this bag fits the bill.  (BTW - no discount or freebie here for this review - I paid for this!)<br />PROS:<br />1. Material: feels and looks professional, good color, seems at the very least to be water repellent<br />2. Zippers: seem strong enough, especially when loaded - two of them house the briefcase handles<br />3. Padding: quality -  on the backpack straps and particularly the section directly meant for the computer<br />4. Compartments: although the pictures do not necessarily show this, there are zippers on the outside, and inside, a pocket with divisions for pencils/pens/highlighters.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Backpack adjustable straps: are on the lower part not allowing for easy adjustment while on your back<br />2. Lower connection backpack straps: hidden - cannot see whether sewn in well or not<br />3. Strap to hold computer in place: oddly long, which would allow for movement and sliding around, something you don't want your computer to do when inside<br />4. No compartment/pocket for a water bottle (my pet peeve)<br />5. PRIMARY (HUGE) ISSUE: Backpack straps which rest on upper trapezoids (left and right) are situated in a very uncomfortable position when fully loaded.  I'm unsure if it's the angle or the placement, but the straps are too close to your neck and would cause pain.  Primarily for this reason, I'm returning the backpack.  Sad because even with the other cons (more annoyances than anything else) if it were not for this one, I would've kept the backpack because the pros outweigh the cons.<br /><br />Pictures: It's important to see how a backpack will perform in my daily life.  Therefore, the pictures provide a sense of how much stuff this can carry, with the contents both packed and unpacked.<br /><br />Contents: Lenovo ThinkPad T460 in neoprene case, keys, 1 1/2&#34; loose-leaf binder, yearly planner, scientific calculator, computer power cord, small cosmetic case, large cosmetic bag which houses pens/pencils/highlighters/usb drive/mouse/headphones and wallet.<br /><br />Final thoughts: if only used as a briefcase/shoulder bag, this may be for you.  However, if the primary purpose is to function as a backpack, good luck.  I think another reviewer mentioned the oddly-placed backpack straps, but sadly, I ignored that advice.<br />In addition, cannot ascertain the strength of the shoulder strap as I didn't want to break the seal, but it is pictured.",B01F710ME0,B088LWZRQ8,AEE2PYYDXJGV6ZO3YHZBBEMSUG4Q,44:01.0,98,TRUE,2657,5.4,2,5

4,Nice Video Light for Vloggers,"I selected this light for working with my camera, though I have other lights that are good for the tasks I have in mind. I have had good experiences with Logitech products and I had good expectations for this light. For the most part I am pleased with it.<br /><br />This is a small LED-based light that is designed to attach to a flat screen monitor and be used for video lighting. The target audience is very clearly vloggers and video makers, though it can be adapted for other uses with some thought. The main feature of this light which is important enough to mention is that it is a non-strobing LED, meaning no striping when at high shutter speeds.<br /><br />The light has a couple of settings that can be adjusted by buttons on the back. It can be brightened or darkened, and the color temperature can be adjusted as needed. I personally like using a warm setting more than a cool setting, but that's a preference and it changes based on what I am doing. There is some graduation in the levels though they are granular enough for my needs.<br /><br />The head of the light can be tilted forward and backward, so there is some adjustment that can be made. It is not adjustable from side to side, though. Also, it must be mounted on a surface where it can hang, not placed on a desk stand-alone. As such, it is specifically designed for hanging on a monitor.<br /><br />The one thing about this light that I do not care for is that it does not have any battery capacity. That is, it must be plugged in to a USB outlet to work. That's probably again related to being marketed as a vlogging tool, but it does reduce portability when a USB port is unavailable for use. It can be rigged to work with a power bank which is a sloppy work-around, but this is simply a patch.<br /><br />This is a decent light for video work and it is very definitely a tool for vloggers and video makers. It has no battery capacity so it must be plugged in to work, but otherwise it is a nice light that works well.",B097QZGRCQ,B0BWFQGY7C,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,03:40.3,0,FALSE,1998,4,4,4
5,Affordable Small-System Solution,"I selected this camera to mount on my front porch, with the intention of keeping a watchful eye on the front of the house. I was very skeptical of this camera because of the price and assumed that it would be a budget-grade solution as a result. It has proven to be better than I anticipated.<br /><br />This is a single-camera solution with no dedicated monitoring station. It connects via the WiFi network and it can be monitored via phone which is handy when you’re away. It includes a power supply and all of the mounting equipment (minus the tools) to set it all up for outdoor use.<br /><br />All of that sounds great, but as I write this the camera sells for under $40.<br /><br />It has not performed like a $40 camera. It has been rock-solid so far – it’s stable, it has remained connected except for when I have had router issues, the image in the daytime is excellent and the night-vision mode is far and away better than I expected – I can read license plates on cars in the driveway at night.<br /><br />This is not a complete security solution but rather is a single camera for zone security. There are more complete systems that offer more features and capabilities, but these cost a lot more and cover broader areas with multiple cameras. If you just need a single camera to monitor a fairly small area, and you have a wireless network to connect it to, this is a very affordable solution.",B07QMSHWBH,B07QMSHWBH,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,35:57.9,0,FALSE,1405,2.7,5,3
5,No Setup Required - It Just Works,"I recently purchased a new [Windows] laptop that has a Type C connector, and I selected this unit to get more USB ports as well as the card reader. So far it has worked out well for me and it seems to work as designed, and with no tweaks or software installation required.<br /><br />This little unit is small and it easily fits in a shirt pocket though the cord does impact the way it fits in said pocket. It’s a little bigger than a comb but smaller than a candy bar.  It feels solid and well-made and so far has shown no signs of fatigue or weakness.<br /><br />I plugged it in and the fit was very snug so I had to work with it to get it plugged in properly. That’s actually a positive – it should not come unplugged unexpectedly when I move my laptop or plug something else into it, a problem I have had on occasion with MicroUSB devices.<br /><br />Windows recognized it immediately and it didn’t seem to need any extra device drivers or anything to make it work. It picked up the Ethernet interface as well as the USB hub, and that’s really all I would expect before plugging in anything else. The card reader works and I was able to read images off of the card I use in my camera through this device.<br /><br />I have not yet tried it under Linux but that’s coming shortly. I also have an Android tablet with a Type C port with which I will try this device as well.<br /><br />I have not yet tried the HDMI adapter. I have a use for it as my laptop actually does not have an HDMI port on-board and I’d like to attach it to my television to stream video.<br /><br />Would I add anything? I would have liked to see an integrated wireless adapter or a Bluetooth receiver built in, though I have those built in to my system and adding those to this unit would drive up the cost a bit. I would probably make the unit slightly larger too.<br /><br />So far, this device has been solid for me. It works right out of the box without any setup required – plug it in and you’re ready to go.",B07G2FHYZB,B07G2FHYZB,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,46:11.4,3,FALSE,1989,4.1,5,4
4,Works Well with Linux,"I needed a simple dock station to copy some hard disks.  The All in 1 HDD Docking System fitted my needs nicely.  I was able to insert an old Maxtor IDE drive in the first slot and a brand new SATA SSD in the second slot.<br /><br />I had hoped to test the one-button copy feature so I powered it up and tried to follow the directions.  Both drives were recognized, however I could not get the docking system to perform a drive copy.  This could be due to either a brand new, unformatted SSD or due to the use of the Linux EXT2 file system (not FAT or NTFS).  If I have a chance I will test copying between two FAT file systems.<br /><br />With both the Maxtor and SSD plugged in, I added an SD card.  I could mount the card and read the files from it, or copy files from it to either of the hard disks or to my system disk!<br /><br />I tried using both a CF card and an SD card at the same time.  However, I was not able to successfully access both at the same time.  When I removed the SD card, I could read the CF card.<br /><br />The device came with a short manual which was written in broken English.  It was marginally useful and largely discussed how to use the PC Clone EX program that came with the docking device.<br /><br />The docking system includes a USB hub.  To test it, I plugged a Seagate USB hard disk into the USB port on the front.  I was able to copy files from my camera's CF card to the Seagate USB drive.  As a final test, I plugged a Maple Mini embedded ARM processor into the other port on the USB hub and uploaded an Arduino-compatible sketch.  The USB hub works great!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost, I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",B00N1S46SA,B00N1S46SA,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,46:31.0,2,FALSE,1854,4,4,4
2,Poor Construction,"I selected the Meade 20225 TerrStar telescope as my youngest son is often asking me where to find certain constellations in the sky and has always been interested in celestial events. I thought this telescope might be a good entry level scope with which to foster his interest. While it does work, I would hesitate to recommend it, mainly on the basis of its build quality but also for its usability.<br /><br />My son decided to assemble it himself and it was done by the time I got home from work. He had no issues putting it together and he managed to get it assembled correctly without any assistance. In short, it's easy to put together. However, his very first comment to me was that it was very cheaply made, and it did not take long to determine what he meant. The whole assembled unit is slightly wobbly and a little unstable though it does not feel like it will tip over without a little help - I would be more concerned about it breaking outright. There is much more lightweight plastic than metal and there are numerous opportunities to break components which all feel cheaply made.<br /><br />One of the packing decisions made was to put the lenses in the carry bag which is folded up in the box. So, until we realized this we thought the lenses were not included in the package. While this is not a major problem - all the parts are there - it does show a lack of understanding of the consumer who is likely to call the support line first before searching the carry bag.<br /><br />We took the telescope outside and started looking for objects in the sky, and we discovered a serious issue. Once we find something to view, the scope's positional setting is so loose that even the very slightest bump either knocks the object from view or causes the scope to shake which makes viewing impossible. At a minimum the scope itself should be mounted tightly and should move only with deliberate effort. I have found no way to tighten this up which is very unfortunate.<br /><br />I have trouble recommending this telescope. It's very cheaply made and this shows all through the product from assembly to use. Research other options before selecting this telescope.",B005L1LKF2,B005L1LKF2,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,19:27.0,0,FALSE,2171,1,2,1

4,Five stars for the audio. The video: meh.,"Sorry for the lengthy review.<br /><br />I love this sound bar. Five stars for the audio. No doubt about it.<br />I consider myself relatively gadget-savvy, but certainly not tech-savvy. I love gadgets, but I'm an idiot when it comes to sound and sound-related technology. I only recently stopped using ear buds altogether and switched to my Sennheisers as my primary listening `phones.<br /><br />My family and I live on the third floor of a three-apartment house, and not once did I ever consider getting surround sound. I have the speakers for it, as they were hand-me-downs, but I don't want to set them up lest I receive the wrath of my neighbors. That, and I don't even have the connections necessary on my TV (my TV is two years old; the speakers are far older than that). I recently heard about sound bars (though the PS3 one that came out a while ago caught my eye before), and thought that might be a better fit for me.<br /><br />I don't normally track Vine orders, as they usually get delivered on Tuesdays. But I was so excited about this one I kept looking on UPS's website, only to be disappointed to read that it had not been delivered on Tuesday; when I got home, my hopes were ultimately crushed when I found the ""undelivered"" sticky on my mailbox. What's one more day? I signed the note and left it for the UPS man.<br />When I finally got the package the next day, I realized why they needed a signature: the box was huge! And there's no outer box, so all that's delivered is the product in its factory packaging, as if you bought it from the store yourself. Everybody and they momma are going to know what you ordered. But, thankfully, I don't have to worry about theft in my neighborhood too much.<br />So when I unboxed it, I was surprised to see how little real estate the actual sound bar took. Initially, I was surprised to see how big the box was, as I didn't think the bar itself was too big. But then I realized the box was oversized to accommodate the subwoofer.<br /><br />Instructions were easy enough, but the HDMI set-up was a pain. There's a disc with the manual, but I would prefer if LG's website lets you download it (as of this review, they still don't have it up). Out of three HDMI cables I had lying around (two from the same brand), only one worked. I have two Mediabridge cables, one six- and the other nine-feet, and a cheapo one which came with my Comcast DVR. Only the Mediabridge six-foot cable worked, for some odd reason, so that's the one currently connecting the sound bar.<br />Nevertheless, the Internet capabilities are going to be wasted on me, I'm assuming, as I already have services such as Netflix on my PS3, and I don't see myself switching to the sound bar any time soon.<br />I haven't tried the other apps, so I can suggest getting this model without the Internet capabilities for the cheaper price tag. Really, you're paying $100-$150 just to have Wi-Fi on it, when many most likely have such services on other devices.<br /><br />There's an optical cable included for the audio, as well as a wall mount. I won't use the mount till we buy a house, so I can't say much on that.<br /><br />I love that the subwoofer is wireless. I knew where I wanted to place the sound bar and subwoofer before they arrived, and I was pleased that I was able to put them exactly where I wanted. I have a 47"" Toshiba, so the sound bar and TV are perfectly matched.<br /><br />My initial sound tests were Game of Thrones, Arrested Development, and Dexter's Laboratory (I'm a kid at heart), and the sound was amazing. I've never used other sound bars, but, considering this isn't a 5.1 surround sound system, I was blown away. The sound was perfect, exceeding my expectations. As I mentioned, I'm a newb to the audio world, so forgive my ignorance and bliss. I'm perfectly content with my sound bar, though, as our current ""surround"" sound system.<br /><br />My wife didn't like it at first--and still kinda doesn't--as she thought ""it's too loud,"" but over the first weekend, when we watched The Last Stand (awful movie, by the way), she changed her mind. She said it was like being in a theater--at least, the next best thing.<br /><br />The bar itself is great, but the subwoofer really adds that punch where you can *feel* the sound. I have the subwoofer next to the couch for extra oomph.<br /><br />All in all, I love it. I give the audio itself five stars, but I'm taking one star away for the Internet services. Honestly, I don't see the reason for paying the extra money when the other model with audio only is just as good. I still haven't used the video options, but will update this review if I ever do.<br /><br />The remote is a bit large for just a sound bar, as I'm using only the power and volume buttons, as well as the occasional input button for Bluetooth. The latter feature is nice, but don't go moving your iPod/iPhone/other streaming device around, as the connection breaks easily. But when it's still, the music quality sounds great.<br /><br />After getting this sound bar, I no longer care what my neighbors might think.",B00BD7UXXS,B00BD7UXXS,AEUAL3EJKUSTNB4YY6STLYGTJALA,05:49.0,7,FALSE,5091,4.7,4,5

5,"Nice 32"" LCD TV Mount","I purchased this for my 32"" Panasonic LCD TV which is in my bedroom. I wanted to get the TV a little higher up and off of the dresser surface. I asked my landlord to install it for me and he had no problems whatsoever. He works for Bosch Corp. so he knows a thing or two about quality hardware and he assured me that this thing was heavy duty. He was even impressed with the quality of the bolts that were supplied. He jokingly said that he could have mounted my Chevy Impala on that thing, so I have no doubt that this is a quality product which fit my needs perfectly. I paid less than $20.00 about a month ago on Amazon and bundled it with something else to get free shipping and I am glad I didn't wait any longer.

I tried playing music directly off my phone, but alas my speakerphone is only so loud and is constantly drowned out by the LLV.<br /><br />So, I researched Bluetooth speakers and, based on the reviews and popularity, recently purchased two:<br />-[[ASIN:B016XTADG2 Anker SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker with 24-Hour Playtime, 66-Foot Bluetooth Range &amp; Built-in Mic, Dual-Driver Portable Wireless Speaker with Low Harmonic Distortion and Superior Sound - Black]]<br />-[[ASIN:B01LZV6TYQ OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Splashproof Bluetooth Speaker - Designed &amp; Engineered by Cambridge SoundWorks for Richer Bass, HD Sound, and 30-Hour Playtime, 10W+ Power, Water Resistant, Portable Wireless Speaker]]<br /><br />The Anker SoundCore is being returned while I am keeping the OontZ Angle 3 Plus and here is why.<br /><br />I tested both speakers in my home at first. My very first impression, out of the box:<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus -  was nice to touch and just felt solid and very well built.<br />Anker SoundCore - just felt like a simple lightweight brick. It really didn't give the impression of longevity or durability.<br /><br />The set-up guides were quite different from each other.<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - Extremely easy to read, follow and understand (remember, I am not a music nut lol. This was my first time ever using a Bluetooth speaker and was in completely uncharted territory.) It was all in English, and only English and the diagrams were detailed and made the entire set-up process seamless and carefree.<br />Anker SoundCore - This guide was very hard to follow. It is printed in darn near every language, in tiny print and the diagrams were quite small as well. I ultimately did get the speaker paired with my phone and figured out what buttons did what, but it took nearly 15 minutes to do so.<br /><br />Bluetooth Pairing<br />With both speakers and my phone lined up on a table (well within the proximity specified in each set-up guide), both speakers paired, however:<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - MUCH faster in pairing (mere seconds!).<br />Anker SoundCore - took nearly two minutes to complete the pairing process.<br /><br />Pause/Play Button<br />Since I dismount to deliver packages to a customer's door routinely on my route, I really need to have a simply way to pause my music. I really like how both speakers offer this function on directly on the units, saving me from having to handle my phone.<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - I barely press the Play/Pause button and the speaker immediately reacts. There is NO hesitation.<br />Anker SoundCore - I press the Play/Pause button and there is a delay of about 5 seconds.. just long enough to make me think I didn't press hard enough and reach to do it again only for the speaker to finally react.<br /><br />Volume/Overall Playback Quality<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - Wow. Just wow. It is truly unbelievable to hear such full sound, and bass(!), coming from such a small unit. I found myself perfectly pleased with the output without ever reaching max volume on the speaker itself. So I am looking forward to how well it will work in my LLV during my first road test. As for now, I am thoroughly impressed!<br />Anker SoundCore - I maxed out the volume on my phone and the speaker and was just not impressed. If I could guess, I'd say the max output this speaker achieved was only about 25% more than my speakerphone alone (while the OontZ Angle 3 Plus blew it out of the water with close to double, if not more, output than my speakerphone alone).<br />I also noted some kind of distortion or interference type background sound with the Anker SoundCore at mid volume and above.<br /><br />Speakerphone/Mic<br />I was able to answer an incoming phone call on both units as described in each set-up guide. The quality of in-call sound on each speaker differed:<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - My husband's (the caller) voice was crisp and clear, as if he was sitting talking right next to me. There was no distortion or feedback out of the speaker. Husband reported nothing but a clear voice on his phone.<br />Anker SoundCore - Husband's voice was clear, but echoed horribly. No matter what volume level I used. There was no distortion (I was expecting this given the distortion with the music playback) bu the continuous echoing is a major issue for me. Husband reported a slight &quot;faded&quot; type of echo on his phone.<br /><br />Road Test (in my LLV)<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - The sound is amazing in the truck! Thinking I would need it, I maxed the volume on both the speaker and my phone then pressed play on my music. Well, I certainly don't need max volume. I reduced the volume on both the speaker and my phone and found a very happy medium output. This speaker performs perfectly in the loud, rattling setting of a USPS LLV.. even while bouncing down rural dirt two tracks and washboard gravel roads. I am extremely pleased with this tiny speaker.<br />Anker Soundcore - Even with maxed volume settings, I could not get this speaker to perform anywhere near as well as the OontZ Angle 3 Plus. It had volume and was loud enough to hear over the vehicle's own noise, however the distortion/interference mentioned earlier was still present and in the truck during the road test it had what I would describe as an echoing effect on the music, specifically the singers' voices. It just wasn't clear. (I hope that makes sense.)<br /><br />Battery Life/Listen While Charging<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - So far, the battery life is impressive. After receiving it, I charged it overnight (as recommended). I then had it connected to my phone for about an hour of home testing. Turned it off and I next used it at work on a Saturday.. had it powered on and connected to my phone and actively playing music for about 5.5 hours. I then used it again on Monday (much longer and busier days in the USPS, FYI).. had it on, connected and active continuously for nearly 9 hours. I have yet to see the low battery light come on. I plan to see just how many days of work I can get out of a single charge.<br />Anker Soundcore - I have no information for this section on this speaker since I am returning it.<br /><br />Exterior/Cleaning<br />At first, I had the OontZ Angle 3 Plus setting on the dashboard of the LLV. This didn't last more than two stops. Despite having the four rubber &quot;feet&quot;, the speaker still slid around causing more of a distraction than I would like. I ended up setting it on top of my personal bag, in a bin by my feet with the speaker facing up. This move really helped my piece of mind, knowing it will not go anywhere. This speaker has a soft rubber exterior. It is quite nice and feels luxurious, however... this exterior attracts all dust particles within 50 feet! USPS LLVs are *not* known for being the cleanest and even though I moved the speaker from the dust-ridden dashboard to a bin, it was still slathered with dust and dirt by the end of my route. I figured it was a fair trade, sacrificing the appearance for the gain of having decent music. But.. I got home and went to clean it. I will tell you, my expectations of this working were very low. I didn't think the dust would come off that supple rubber. But with a wet paper towel and a few slow wipes, it did. So, it can be cleaned up!<br /><br />Case<br />I did purchase the case for this speaker ([[ASIN:B01NBDY6VP [Official] OontZ Angle 3 Plus Bluetooth Portable Speaker Carry Case, Neoprene with Aluminum Carabiner, reinforced zipper, by Cambridge SoundWorks [NOT FOR OontZ Angle 3]]]). I was mainly wanting a safe way to transport and store the speaker, but after reading the other reviews I was hoping I would be able to keep it clean in the case and still enjoy my music on my route. I received the case and used it yesterday. The case is extremely nice and I appreciate the interior mesh pocket. I have no need for it now, but I'm sure it will come in handy if I ever take this speaker on vacation and need to take the charging cables along. As for playback while in the case? Yeah, it was terribly muffled. It didn't work for me as it apparently has for others. Yet, the case itself is exactly what I was wanting for taking it to and from work. It is not as thickly padded as I would have expected, however it does protect the speaker.<br /><br />Overall, for my specific purpose and intended use for a Bluetooth speaker, the Anker SoundCore simply won't cut it. However, it is still a nice speaker and will perhaps fit your needs perfectly. After all, most people don't drive LLVs and have the same high demands that go along with that. For me, the OontZ Angle 3 Plus is what I'll be bopping down the road to, mailbox to mailbox.<br /><br />Happy hunting! Hope this review helps you out!",B01LZV6TYQ,B01LZV6TYQ,AGMZO7NPGHYPLCOCLMQEDGKNCHVA,18:33.0,736,TRUE,9077,4.6,5,5

The Black drives I've had fail were due to insufficient cooling. Blue are to be used in a PC with one or two drives that sees daily use. That's daily, not 24/365. Not in an array. Each level of Red drive is intended for arrays of different numbers of drives. They are not quiet desktop drives. You really want them somewhere other than next to where you sit.<br /><br />More importantly than all that, carefully check prices in several places. Don't pay the absurd prices that some people want after buying their stock at retail price. They'll go back down.

4,Good deal for the money,"I'm pretty picky about how good speakers perform.  I'm not a hard nose audiophile, but I know good speakers when I hear them.  I have used the same song for decades to truly test the quality of the bass.  That song is Alan Parson's ""The Raven"" and the bass test is the very last note in the song.  Most speaker systems cannot handle this deep bass guitar note at any volume.  This set did.  So as far as the bass, this speaker set passed the toughest test I could throw at it.<br /><br />The high end was strong and clean, the midrange was the only level I saw a little lacking.  This was playing music of the classic rock genre.  I play my music pretty exclusively through Windows Media Player which offers a built-in equalizer.  Just a little adjusting on the equalizer and I had all levels well balanced, sound was very good.<br /><br />Some reviewers had mentioned hearing a hum or the like from the right speaker (the one which contains the power and volume controls).  When I first hooked everything up out of the box I heard it too.  It was noticeable and given time I could see it becoming irritating.  I know what causes this hum and how to fix the problem.  The problem is caused by poor shielding on the speaker wiring.  I added 3 ft. extensions that were double shielded and lo and behold...no more hum, dead silence.  I have since put 10 ft. double shielded extensions on both speakers and they are working flawlessly with zero degradation in performance.  If you check the answered questions you will find the exact extensions you need.  Be careful, not any VGA extension will work for the right speaker!  Keep the original speaker wires away from any power cords or power sources and you should get the same result in the end.<br /><br />I haven't had these speakers for very long so I can't comment on longevity yet.  If they unexpectedly have problems I will definitely update this review.  But in my honest opinion they seem like a good deal for the money.",B003VAHYTG,B01C6ESQM6,AGK3NYKU3CARH7ECUIKNPLUMO4OQ,25:55.0,17,TRUE,1974,1.5,4,2

5,Popped in easy... wondering if it was TOO easy (**updated since initial review).,"UPDATE: I finally had to remove the 'FirePad' from the case. I can confirm it DOES NOT just pop out as easily as it pops in... which is a relief. Upgraded review to 4.5 stars as what keeps this allegedly kid-proof from being 5 is it's a little too hard plasticy (it needs a layer of firm foam around it) and the screen isn't recessed from the edge of the hard plastic. Believe me, an extra layer of foam which would automatically make the screen of the tablet recessed back about 3 mm would make a HUGE difference with a kid... or a 'dropper' adult (🙋🏼‍♀️). I have a review for an iPad mini 6 'kid case' in purple... that case is ideal. If only...<br /><br />I feel like if butter knives and ripped-to-the-quick fingernails aren't involved in putting a tablet in a kid-friendly case, maybe it's not gonna stand up to 🌪MY🌀  kid. This went in so effortlessly, so easily, I wonder if it would pop out, if dropped, as easily as it popped in... I should be thankful it was THAT easy, no cuss-no fuss-no tears-no blood, but I'm so used to the NIGHTMARE of putting iPads in cases (any brand, any price point, any any any) that this legit has me nervous. Hopefully crApple will repair/replace/return his warrantied, practically new crapPad very very very soon (this week 🙏🏻) and I can put it back in its nightmare case and get my new, beloved 'FirePad' back. *FirePad because that's how happy I am with it... see my Reviews for more on that 💛",B08KBJD55Y,B08Z34819L,AHGUAZJBY4UJWO3PLS2NKCUBL2QA,33:59.2,0,TRUE,1434,1.6,5,2

5,For now a 5 start rating. Will update my experience in 30 days or so,"Okay so I will start off that I only paid $49 for this device so a 5 star rating is simply because I'm not heavily invested in this from a cost perspective and for $49 it does the trick and more. I have purchased this inexpensive version to see if I'm a Dashcam kind of person. I purchased the Sandisk 32G card which was super cheap to buy (9.99 I think) and started my dash cam journey.<br /><br />Why 5 stars - It's only day 3 but so far this works as expected. Good resolution and functionality and it is small enough that I installed it behind my rear view mirror and just leave it in my truck. The accessory cord is really long so there is good flexibility to move the camera around my cab as needed and the suction cup mount is the way to go. The packaging was good but the instructions are HORRIBLE.  It's 2015 so I have no idea why you can't spend the time build a quality instruction sheet.  I have had to figure out how to operate the camera on my own which so far has worked.  Today I stuck the camera to the windshield, plugged it in and drove 1 hour to work and another hour back.  Worked flawlessly and I realize that I am a Dashcam kind of person now. Simply plug the mini-USB into your computer and view the video files straight from the explorer menu.  I'm not sure how long this camera will last. I will update as time passes. I recommend a 32g mem card if you plan on using this a lot and recording in HD. For $49 (plus storage card) this is a great insurance policy. 2 cars pulled out in front of me today.  If they had hit me I would have been able to prove them at fault.  Also, turn off the motion sensor while driving unless you want the camera restarting often.  I found to let it just run is the best solution. Maybe use the motion sensor if you are using the camera as a security feature or something.",B00XTSV0G8,B00XTSV0G8,AEK6AABY4MSTUZE43RRLERCDBXVQ,56:48.0,25,TRUE,1828,4.3,5,4

4,Good Cover for New Oasis,"This is my third case for 7&#34; Kindle Oasis. I started with the absolutely horrible Amazon denim cover then I bought a faux leather MoKo cover which was by far better but still not right. Finally I found this CaseBot denim cover. I hope it's the last. The denim has a nice texture and makes the cover easy to hold and the burgundy is quite attractive. The inside of the cover and the lip that completely surrounds the device (there are cutouts for the power button and USB connection) is coated in a soft rubber like neoprene that gives excellent one handed reading control. This lip, which securely holds the device in place, is smooth and comfortable which was nice. I had had to sand the cutout openings on the MoKo case because they were rough. My only minor gripe with this cover is the fabric on the face which is lightly padded is a little loose and might get snagged on something and be torn.

4,Perfectly Adequate Laptop Bag,"Fifteen dollars? Are you kidding me? The outer bag is reasonably durable and decently padded enough to give adequate protection as long as you don't drop it off a cliff or play football with it. The zippers operate smoothly and feel sturdy. The shoulder strap has an okay pad, it's better than nothing. The strap hardware is hard plastic and somewhat cheap feeling. The inner material is a bit thin and chintzy feeling but it will keep papers and your laptop separated well enough. I have two portable hard drives in a soft case and two USB cables in the outer pocket and there's plenty of room with the laptop inside. This is more than enough for what I need and the price can't be beat for what you get.",B00DUGZFWY,B00FB50SBU,AFUSWNVA72MMWHGYWJ652SYX2JJQ,42:20.0,1,TRUE,705,2.2,4,2
4,"Good, General Use Laptop","So far so good. I've had this laptop for just about a month now and it's done everything I expected of it. I'm not a gamer. I needed a machine to maintain my ebook collection, edit and manage my photography as well as general email and web browsing. As another reviewer has mentioned the keyboard is a bit flimsy feeling but I'm getting used to typing lighter and that seems to work. Everything on the laptop works the USB 3.0 port is screaming fast. The memory card reader reads the cards from three of my cameras. The touch screen is very responsive. The only thing I found lacking was no support for playing DVD movies. When I contacted Asus about it they first pointed me towards an uninstalled CD/DVD authoring utility that isn't installed but was put on the drive. When asked again about playing DVD movies they shrugged and suggested I go download something. I'm quite happy with my choice and for the money this does everything I really need.",B00K9PQMD0,B00K9PQMD0,AFUSWNVA72MMWHGYWJ652SYX2JJQ,00:59.0,1,TRUE,950,4.2,4,4

5,"Outstanding protection, although bulky and heavy","I purchased this solely because of how happy I am with the [[ASIN:B00NF4SXSO OtterBox Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Case Defender Series]] that I have been using for the past five months. That case has saved my Note 4 twice from falls, so I did not hesitate to purchase this along with my Tab Pro 8.4.<br /><br />This case WILL add a lot of bulk and weight to your tablet, so if you are looking for sleek, this is NOT the case you want. For me I wanted the assurance that my tablet would be protected and this is the only case that I have found that will do that. The way the rim around the screen is beveled and how it recesses the screen is a nice level of protection. I am guessing that the included screen protector is effective, since I did not use the included one with my Note 4 case (I opted for the Zagg for that phone, but I am using the protector that came with this case and it does allow complete sensitivity. Time will tell.<br /><br />Installation is straightforward and easy. I had mine completely installed in about five minutes. Of course I had prior experience with the Note 4 case, and there was a learning curve because the instructions are a little terse. All of the cutouts are also precise. The case does not hamper access to any feature or interfere with the camera. Ports have tabs that seal them against water and dust. Frankly I do not need that level or protection and actually cut off the tab protecting the charging port. However, if you work in harsh environments those are nice features. Also, I do not use the back cover that has the kickstand for propping the tablet up. Mine spends most of its time on a music stand, but if I were to use it outdoors or in harsh environments, the back cover is an additional layer of protection.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you want protection this is a great case. If you want slim and trendy you will probably not like it, though.",B00IYJCFDO,B00LEF25QW,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,02:17.0,1,TRUE,1892,4.7,5,5
5,Excellent bargain and can be used as disposables or permanent,"I purchased these based strictly on price. They are not the heavy duty ties that are also offered by Velcro, but have a wider range of uses.<br /><br />For one thing at five cents per tie I can use them for temporary cable management when setting up for performances, and not worry of I lose of miss one. Since they come in four rolls of twenty-five each I keep one roll in my gig bag, and the other rolls in a drawer at home. A single roll was all it took to get my morass of wires in my home studio under control, so the hundred-pack I purchased for less than a fast food meal will probably be six to nine months worth of cable management for gigs even if I treat them as disposable.<br /><br />These are thinner than the heavy duty ties and are prone to stretching. However, they are every bit as strong when you are wrapping cable bundles. Do note that you need to separate them by tugging each tie from the roll. But you do need to be careful because the short head that contains the loop will also separate.<br /><br />If you are a musician, computer tech or just want to get wires and cables under control a pack of these is a cost-effective want to do it.",B001E1Y5O6,B09TWVB2TH,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,13:11.0,0,TRUE,1163,2.8,5,3
5,Inexpensive solution for two things,"I purchased this sight unseen, and solely to give my eyes a break from the much smaller laptop monitor I had been using. Since others have gone into the technical details (which are also amply described on this page), I'll stick to what I love about it and how I am now using it.<br /><br />The main thing was price. At less than a hundred fifty bucks I took a chance. Hooking it up was super simple: a power cord, a VGA connection to my laptop (using the included cable), and screwing in the VESA adapter from my [[ASIN:B005C2914C Mount-It! MI-705, 3-Way Adjustable Tilting Desk Mount Bracket]] took literally ten minutes. This comes with a pedestal base that is more than adequate, but I wanted the mount I mentioned to free up desk real estate as well as to make this monitor a grab-and-go solution for a second use, which I'll get into below.<br /><br />If there is one thing that I do not care for, it's the cramped area for connecting cables. The cable adapters for VGA, HDMI and power are inserted vertically, and the VGA and HDMI connections are closer together than necessary. Since I am connecting and disconnecting cables often this is a peeve, but if you plan to install it and leave it in one spot it's not even an issue.<br /><br />The speakers are not the loudest when you are running sound via the HDMI port, but are more than adequate when you directly connect to the audio in port. This monitor comes with a 3.5mm cable for that purpose.<br /><br />For my laptop (an aging ThinkPad) it is literally plug and play. I have finally migrated from XP to Windows 7 and this monitor's model was immediately recognized.<br /><br />My second use is to press this into service as a large sheet music display. I am mirroring the screen using an [[ASIN:B00ZWOU5R2 EZcast 5GHz Wireless HDMI Streaming Media Player]] to display [[ASIN:B00WLIDHA4 MobileSheetsPro Music Reader]] mirrored from a tablet screen. Since this monitor weighs less than ten pounds it is fairly easy to set up at a gig. As a side note, if you do intend to use this on a gig or as a karaoke display this is an excellent mount: [[ASIN:B001TMCVDW Audio2000'S AST420Y Portable Flat Panel TV/Monitor Stand with Foldable Tripod Legs]].<br /><br />Do note that the HDMI port will not power devices. For the EZcast dongle I have to use either a battery backup or a small wall wart (the same kind I charge my phone and tablet with), but that is not an issue either. I figured that for the price some corners had to be cut.<br /><br />Although this is designed to be a desktop monitor I do wish there was a remote option for it. When I am using it to extend my laptop display it's perfect. For the screen mirroring use I mentioned a remote would be helpful.<br /><br />The bottom line is I am thoroughly pleased with this monitor and may, in fact, purchase a second one so I am not swapping my laptop monitor out to take on gigs.",B00RPJOQQ8,B07FFCTZLC,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,26:39.0,2,TRUE,2896,3.1,5,3
5,Perfect for low draw USB devices,"I received this as a free review sample. First, this is for low draw devices like mice, keyboards, thumb drives and the such. It will NOT support an external drive that gets its power from your machine's USB port.<br /><br />For me this is perfect because it's USB 2.0 only (although it will also kick down to USB 1.1). I am using it on an old ThinkPad T61, which immediately recognized it as soon as I plugged it in. I did not test the Ethernet connection (which needs a separate driver on my XP machine), but the USB ports are problem free.<br /><br />As a test I tried this hub on my Note 4 phone using a [[ASIN:B00LM4PDUU LinkS Micro-USB 3.0 OTG Adapter]] and the USB ports worked like they did on my T61. Again, I did not test the Ethernet port, but did populate two USB ports with a keyboard and mouse, and both were immediately recognized by the phone.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a nice way to expand USB ports for low power draw devices. The Ethernet port is a bonus and especially if you need to direct connect to a router, but you may need to download a driver to get it working.",B00LM07HKI,B00LM07HKI,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,14:02.0,0,FALSE,1094,4.6,5,5
5,Great idea well executed,"For bicycle enthusiasts this is an excellent speaker/radio combination that has decent sound and a lot of convenient touches. I received mine as a review sample from the manufacturer.<br /><br />I'll cover the sound quality first. In a word, it's adequate. Not overly spectacular, but sufficiently loud to be heard over road noise while trekking through streets and paths. I do not view the quality as a problem because in most biking environments the sound level is more important than fidelity. Plus, the safety factor of having a hands-free solution is the major reason for getting one of these.<br /><br />What impressed me is when I turned this on all I had to do is scan for bluetooth devices from my phone and it popped right up. I did not have to press a multifunction button and chant, hoping the device would show up like other bluetooth speakers - it was immediately there.<br /><br />Another thing I love is the buttons are on the top of the case and when the speaker is turned on they light up blue. I have stationary speakers which have buttons that blend into the case so well I cannot readily find them, so this feature removes one major distraction when you are on the road. In the dark the lights are soft enough to not affect your night vision. The only improvement that I can think of is to use red lights instead of blue because those would actually promote night vision. Perhaps the designers will do that in the next generation.<br /><br />Some of the other nice touches are the ample inside space for a phone and other incidentals, plus a ring clip on the outside for your keys. I also love the three point attachment to your handle bar and steering post. It is easy to attach and remove. In fact, that takes mere seconds.<br /><br />Having a removable battery is yet another design factor that makes this a value. Most bluetooth speakers on the market have a fixed, internal battery that will eventually wear out.

4,"A good computer, after some tweaking","Not a bad laptop for the price. The laptop itself is in brand new condition. But because it's a model from 2016, it did require a Google search and a visit to the HP support website for a BIOS update for the computer to recognize the latest Windows 10 updates, and the computer also required an update there to fix a VCRUNTIME140.dll error. I also kept getting an error message requiring an update to HP 3D DriveGuard after the latest Windows 10 updates. In other words, expect to do some tinkering with your computer to get this refurb up and running properly. (One other little thing: When Amazon shipped the laptop, they overlooked removing from the box the original owner's receipt from a well-known national department store chain, which showed that buyer paid about $80 less for this laptop than I did as a refurb.)",B01MRJFFFW,B01MRJFFFW,AELSHTSXAERWIFIXFRS75SWVJ25A,49:08.5,3,TRUE,821,5.1,4,5

5,Suprisingly substantial,"Just received these speakers today. Very easy to install on desktop PC. I like Classical Baroque playing lightly in the background while I'm online and these speakers are absolutely fabulous for this.<br />I put the sub on the floor below my desk off to the left, the two mains on either side of the monitor and checked my audio software settings then fired up some online Baroque live from Zurich and the sound quality was immediately impressive.<br />All power, volume and bass settings are built into a very nice control pod you can place nearby on your desk. I found using a light touch on the sub power gives nice bass accentuation without adding unrealistic and unpleasant booming.<br />The sub is rather heavy with a hefty solid feel to it and it's addition to the sound is substantial even at low volume levels.<br />All in all, I'm very happy and my ears are floating away with the delights of the Baroque era as I type this review.<br />Amazon has got me spoiled with so many fine products and the best customer service on earth.<br />And thanks to Cyber Acoustics for this great audio system priced so reasonably.<br />Edit:<br />Okay, now it's June 19th, I don't like these speakers any more at all.

5,"If you're a Frontier customer, or any other service for that matter, my review should help...","I've been trying to get good coverage in my garage so the security cams and smart devices don't get dropped connections, or long wait times when I try to connect from my app. This is finally the one! Frontier uses and all in one gateway, Arris NVG468MQ. In order to use the Netgear as the main router, I would need Frontier's help to put the Arris in bridge mode. I'm not sure if they can even do this, and since I purchased my own Arris to save rental fees, I wasn't sure how much they'd be willing to help either. So I didn't bother to try, instead, I set up the Netgear router in AP mode. To do this...<br /><br />1. Go to Frontier's admin to turn off all wi-fi modes. Turn off both 2.4 and 5.0 modes.<br />2. Connect ethernet cable from the WAN port of the Netgear Router, to any available lan port of your Frontier gateway. Turn it on.<br />3. Using your smartphone or PC, connect to the Netgear wifi using the credentials labeled on the Netgear Router.<br />4. That's it. You should be online with the new wi-fi, but you'll want to change some things such as the orbi's admin password, your SSID's, etc. When you launch a browser under this new wi-fi, Netgear's admin should pop up allowing you to login to change your credentials, if it doesn't, then use routerlogin.net or orbilogin.net.<br />5. Since you've disabled Frontier's wifi, all your connected devices at home no longer works. But if you change your orbi's SSID to the same SSID that you were using, all your devices will work again. Keep in the mind, the Orbi system allows 4 different SSIDs. So you can still create other networks with different security levels.<br />6. Place the Orbi Satellite where you need better coverage. Power it on. Go back to Orbi Router and hit the sync button, within 30 seconds, you need to go back to the satellite and hit the sync button as well. Once they sync, which is indicated by solid blue for a few minutes, all lights will then be turned off. So keep that in mind, when it's up and running, there are no lights on the orbi router, or orbi satellite. I'm used to seeing some sort of lights on router equipment, so when there wasn't any lights, I was wondering if it was working properly. As it turns out, all lights are turned off when everything is up and running properly.<br /><br />Even if you're not Frontier, the process I laid out above, to connect the Orbi in AP mode, should be similar. Hope this has been helpful! This is 5-Stars all the way!",B08FXSBN11,B09XK17BN5,AHR6RGZTLOMBD7EBF3OK43JWMGNQ,56:53.0,2,FALSE,2460,3.3,5,3

5,"No PC required, no need to bypass hdcp, the best standalone capture device!","[[VIDEOID:378d5548ce50f90f868da94f7017d6b7]] Nobody has mentioned this yet, maybe it's because this is their first capture device, so they don't realize how awesome this thing is... But the best thing about this device is that you DO NOT need a hdmi splitter to bypass hdcp. If you've tried other capture devices, you might have ran into this issue. You will get a black screen. I was pleasantly surprised no splitter was necessary. There are so many use cases for this device, mostly people will use it to capture game play. My use case is recording Laker games. Frontier no longer carries my Lakers in Southern California, so I'm using my relatives Spectrum credentials. LOL! But doing that, I don't have any DVR functionality. This clone device doesn't give me dvr functionality, but it gives me the next best thing, which is a recorded game I can watch again WITHOUT taking the file back to my pc. You can just watch your recordings on the same tv, because this cloner is a playback device as well! The playback screen, has a nifty picture in picture preview screen. Watch my video for a little demo. Regarding sources, you can connect 1 source at a time to the Cloner, or connect multiple sources using a HDMI hub. I have the Caavo, which is a universal remote as well has a 4 port HDMI hub, connected to this cloner and it works very well.<br /><br />The only con is that some remote functions are laggy. Recording will take 3 to 4 seconds before it actually starts recording, but that's understandable because your hard drive is probably asleep and it needs to wake it up. BTW, you need to attach a hard drive to this. I have a 4tb WD passport attached to it and it works very well. But when accessing the playback menu, I feel this should be snappy, but it takes about 3 to 5 seconds. Once you're in the menu, when you click on a file to play, it is pretty fast. Just getting to the menu is slow. Overall, I still give this 5-Stars.",B087TM4YRN,B08VNF5Q4M,AHR6RGZTLOMBD7EBF3OK43JWMGNQ,10:35.7,6,FALSE,1940,2.4,5,2

I think we now live in a world where we have a gazillion cables in our home, so most likely you are still going to reach for whatever cable you need. Theoretically, these could be useful when you're in a bind. For whatever reason, lets say your lost your iphone cable, these will come in handy. But if you have a choice of the real cable or using this cable with the adapter, the choice will always be the real cable simply because they charge faster. You lose a bit of speed using these magnetic adapters. I know myself, I know my habits, and I'm 100% sure that I won't be able to find the box with all the adapter heads when I need it one day. LOL!

3,Subtle Wavy Diagonal Lines....,"You know I see a lot of positive reviews, and if you're happy that's all that matters. But I'm wondering if all the positive is because people are not comparing one adapter to another, so they don't know any better. This adapter is a generic design, most likely a white label product, meaning many people are selling the same thing, and they are just slapping their own logo on it. I bought this version and the MayFlash version, and after comparing them, I returned this generic version. I got wavy diagonal lines with this generic version. The picture is still okay, but I could see the lines. With the MayFlash, it  was gone. The picture was much smoother. I don't know if using a projector makes a difference, but that is what I'm using, an ultra short throw projector with a 120"" screen.  With such a big image, maybe I'm seeing the diagonal lines much easier. So I'm not sure if this is the case for people using smaller LCD tvs. In any case, all else being equal, if the mayflash could eliminate the lines for me on a 120"" image, it would surely do a spectacular job for smaller screens. If you see subtle wavy diagonal lines, then give the mayflash a try. If you don't see any lines with this version, then stick with it, no need to tinker. This was just my experience.",B07WSHD6W9,B07WSHD6W9,AHR6RGZTLOMBD7EBF3OK43JWMGNQ,54:34.5,3,TRUE,1277,4.5,3,5

5,Saved my headset,"These SOULWIT Cooling-Gel Ear Pads Cushions were not made for my headset, which is a USB gaming headset by [[ASIN: B01E8RS598 Sades]], which is no longer being sold.<br /><br />Ear cups are pretty much the first thing to go on a headset and unless you have an expensive brand, it is hard to find a replacement cup for your specific headset.  After two years of use, the cup of my gaming headset was falling apart and leaving little bits of plastic on my face after I use it.  Rather than throwing away the headset, I wanted to try and find something that might work with it.  I got lucky with this SOULWIT ear cup.  It is attached via a stretchable flap, which is exactly how my old cups attached to the headset.<br /><br />As you can see from my pictures, the shapes of the cups weren't the same as the originals had an odd angle to them but in the end, they fit and they are really comfortable.<br /><br />The material is glossy on the sides, but where it touches your head, it is a soft cloth.  I don't sweat a lot when I wear these so sweat being absorbed into the cup isn't an issue here, but I can see where someone who sweats will have problems with it.

3,I really wanted this to work for me...,"There are so many good things about GripGear's Movie Maker 2 Set that I just had to take the plunge and purchase it despite some of the problems identified by various youtube reviews.  Unfortunately, I have to agree with many of their points and eventually, had to admit that some are showstoppers for me.<br /><br />First, I want to state what is good about the Movie Maker 2 Set:<br />-- Low cost, comparatively.  While there are other sliders that are in the same price range, those don't have the same versatility and portability.  The motor can be used by itself to get 360 panorama shots and the track can be broken down and easily fit in a backpack.  Additional lengths of track can also be purchased separately at a low cost.  No other product on Amazon does all of this and would require separate purchases.<br />-- Remote control.  While we expect remotes for almost everything electronics these days, I was surprised by the fact that many sliders/panorama motors do not come with one.<br />-- Versatility.  Already mentioned previously, but I really want to emphasize that this is a unique feature of this product.  In addition to the points already listed, the Movie Maker 2 set can also be used vertically<br /><br />Negatives:<br />-- Top speed too slow:  I'm in agreement with many youtube reviews that the highest speed is still not fast enough for some shots.  This is why you will see many videos shot with this movie maker set sped up, making all of the videos look like timelapses.<br />-- Lowest speed too fast:  When doing actual timelapse over two or three hours, the resulting video pans too fast.  So while your timelapse subject is moving at the right speed, the camera movement is just too fast, making it uncomfortable to watch.<br /><br />-- Weak 1/4"" camera mount.  The motor is made very specifically for the camera mount that was included with the set.  Unfortunately, if your camera is not balanced or front heavy, it is difficult to get the tilt head to stay put without some grunt work turning the tightening screw.<br /><br />I'm not a professional cinematographer so I thought my requirements would not be very strict, but not being able to get the shots I wanted due to the speed limitations makes me feel like this set is ALMOST what I wanted but it's just not there yet.  I hope that the manufacturer can improve this product a little more and bring it across the finish line.",B075S79Q9C,B075S79Q9C,AFXAMSEN6MT4WQHSXCV4JRGXWODA,00:29.2,11,TRUE,2416,4.3,3,4
2,"Passthrough video quality bad, drivers bad, recording quality good","I purchased this HDMI Capture USB device to record a Windows desktop session.  What I noticed is that the passthrough video quality is very bad.  What is clear text coming out of the computer becomes blurry by the time it gets to the TV.  What this means is that you can't keep this device plugged in permanently to record when necessary.  You'd have to settle for plugging it in only when recording.  Perhaps for gaming devices that have larger text and buttons, it wouldn't be a big problem.<br /><br />This device can also be used to live stream by plugging it in to the USB port on your PC.  A few problems here:<br />-- This is only USB 2.0<br />-- The USB port is also used as the power supply for the device.  This means that if your PC doesn't provide enough power through its USB port (especially if you have an external drive plugged in to the device), you won't be able to use this function.  They did not include those two-headed dongles to provide additional power.<br />-- The drivers are bad.  I was able to get OBS to preview the device only after a lot of changing inputs around.  VLC will not work with it.<br /><br />What I do like about it is that while the passthrough quality is pretty bad, the resulting recording isn't.  You can certainly tell that it is a recording, probably due to the video compression but all of the text from the 1080p desktop is readable.<br /><br />I also like the fact that you can record directly to a USB drive with scheduled recording capabilities.  The UI of the built-in software is straight out of VHS days but it does the basics of what you need.  The convenience of being able to press record on the remote to start your capture means you can set up your PC how you need it without having to also manage your desktop recording software.",B077P52RV8,B077P52RV8,AFXAMSEN6MT4WQHSXCV4JRGXWODA,01:50.0,4,TRUE,1793,2.7,2,3

3,Decent TV Ceiling Mount - Could be Better,"We recently moved in to a new house and needed this mount to install a TV on our patio. I measured the VESA holes on our TV and knew this would work prior to ordering so that was not an issue.<br /><br />This will hold a 55” Visio TV from a vaulted ceiling.<br /><br />Installation is not as straightforward as I have experienced with other mounts though not terribly difficult either.  The issues with installation really come from limited space to work to attach the parts together and there not being great instructions.<br /><br />A few tips we found as we installed that will help you - first locate your ceiling joist stud to mount into.  Then find the distance from the wall where your TV can swivel both left and right to the farthest point you desire - then mark your spot.<br /><br />As with all mounting brackets you want to mount into a stud with as many bolts as possible.<br /><br />In terms of use this works but there are features that just should be more user friendly.  For instance if the height is in the highest position the cables will be pinched in place and can not be moved at all - the cable pass through should have a notch so this is not an issue as it is never good to have cables being pinched.<br /><br />In addition if you want to either swivel or tilt the TV a hex key is required instead of being able to do this with a finger tightening knob like most mounts - this is definitely the worst design flaw in my opinion.  This issue has left us unable to rotate our TVs mount that is “able to swivel” when we’ve had guests at our house due to not being able to locate the correct sized hex key.  Ugh.<br /><br />This mount works, but I would really only recommend it for locations where the user does not intend to alter the tilt or direction of the TVs screen very often.",B08ZNWX6YQ,B08ZNWX6YQ,AEP4CUO23WOOOEYSJBXWYLLHD5IQ,57:45.4,0,FALSE,1803,4.2,3,4
5,Outstanding PoE Injector for Long Runs,"I have been working with security camera products for over 20 years - over that time I have installed systems for businesses, corporations and individuals - from enormous multimillion dollar systems to single camera nursery monitors.  I’ve consulted on large projects and written about security vulnerabilities within networks for trade publications.<br /><br />This is a field I know well.  Over the years the technology has improved and become less and less expensive to produce.  It is now practical to install security systems that would have only previously been used in commercial settings in residential.<br /><br />Like most people who understand security cameras and their vulnerabilities I completely avoid WiFi cameras on most installations.  While they are much easier to set up they are also far more vulnerable to hacking and security breaches.<br /><br />Most of the systems I build and setup utilize Blue Iris, PoE switches and cameras.  While initially this may seem more complicated, in the end it really isn’t and the system is far more stable and customizable.<br /><br />PoE injectors, such as this one by AD-Net, are the perfect solution for when a camera needs to be placed at a farther distance from your central hub.<br /><br />I set this up a bit over 3 months ago to power a camera located approximately 750’ from where this box is plugged in.  I make my own Ethernet cables for these types of runs using trueCABLE Cat6 Direct Burial ( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VPGDBKW/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_veE6FbZ3QK01F ) and pass through modular plugs ( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0839DMK75/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_5yE6FbX7NDWNX ).  I utilized the same wire to run between the master and slave and had excellent results.  This is where primary loss will occur and thus is critical to use the highest quality wires if using this over a large distance.<br /><br />Something that is important to understand when running PoE systems is “line loss” - this refers to the power lost along the run of cable.  The longer the cable the more loss there will be.  While this device is capable of delivering 16W it can not deliver that over a 800 meter (.49 mile) run.  It is important to review the chart pictured in the listing to understand the drop in power and speed over distance.<br /><br />I ran this to a fairly power hungry PTZ camera that constantly scans the area.  As I mentioned I have tested this device for a bit over 3 months and it has performed without any issue.  Even though this is powering a large PTZ varifocal camera, from well over 700’ away, that is constantly scanning I have never experienced any drop in power that caused it to pause or drag.  While I wouldn’t describe this device as plug and play installation was not difficult.  I have been thoroughly impressed by this PoE injector and highly recommended it.<br /><br />Why do I wait a few months to write my review?  I have found many products perform perfectly when first received, but within a couple of months they begin to glitch and have issues.  Like most consumers, I find this incredibly frustrating as then it is typically beyond the return window and I’m left with another useless broken device.  During my testing I really push the limits of each device, I have them run 24/7 and maximize their capabilities in order to discover if there are any inherent flaws.  While this process is time consuming, I have found it is the best way to determine what products are utilizing inferior components and what products really are worth purchasing as they will hold up and perform as expected for the long term.",B0876Q888L,B0876Q888L,AEP4CUO23WOOOEYSJBXWYLLHD5IQ,52:41.1,2,FALSE,3599,4.9,5,5
4,IMPRESSIVE ROOM MONITORING CAMERA LAMP,"This new video camera lamp by Panasonic is really a quality product - outstanding camera, nice lamp, and great features seen in few other systems.<br /><br />Set up was very easy requiring minimal effort - I just followed the enclosed directions and what the app said and breezed through putting it together and setting it up.<br /><br />The HomeHawk App is easy to use and overall quite intuitive.  I’ve had no problem figuring it out as I’ve worked my way around within it.  Once you get into the more complex settings it takes going to multiple areas of the app which is unnecessary.<br /><br />The lamp has many settings to choose from - the preset modes are Home, Away and Basic, each with different predetermined settings or you can create your own.<br /><br />The camera holds up to a 256 GB microSDXC card (Class 10, or UHS Speed Class 1 or higher) so you won’t have to worry about monthly cloud storage fees.  Once the card is full it will automatically write over the oldest data.  It records both audio and video data and can be set to record in a multitude of ways.<br /><br />The camera records at up to 1920 x 1080 pixels, 2.0 megapixel, and 140 degrees - providing an ultra clear image of the entire room.  While the lens is discreet it is visible if anyone looks at the front of the lamp.  This is certainly not a hidden camera.<br /><br />The lamp has three different sensors that detect presence - it detects motion, sound and temperature.  In my tests I found this system to be incredibly accurate at detecting when there was a presence in the room and recording.<br /><br />The base of the lamp holds eight AA batteries that act as a backup power source in the case of a power outage and will power the lamp for 1 hour.<br /><br />One thing to note, while the listing says that it provides color night vision - what really happens is when the lamp detects presence it turns the lamp on in order to record in color.  True night vision - in the dark - is monochrome.<br /><br />While the listing states that the device or app can be connected to Dropbox for free cloud based video storage I have yet to find where it’s possible to do that and the online guides do not refer to it.<br /><br />As someone who has used, reviewed and written about SmartHome products for many years I can say this is a quality product.  I can see a few areas where it can be improved on.  While the LED lamp provides a nice ambient light source it would be far better if colored light could be selected to match other SmartHome lighting.  More shielding should be in place to prevent interference from other electronics - I assume that is the cause of the issues other reviewers have experienced.  The app can use a bit of work in order to make it more straightforward in regards to the settings.<br /><br />This is an extremely high quality camera system built into a nice modern lamp.  It has sleek lines and will compliment most any room’s decor.  The lamp provides a very pleasant ambient light while also providing video and audio surveillance and security.<br /><br />This is a product that I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend.<br /><br />⭐️As with all Drew’s Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

2,WOW!  That was a HUGE disappointment.,"I had been anxiously waiting to try out the NETGEAR Nighthawk.  I’d read over the impressive specs long before it was released, I’ve read glowing reviews touting it as the fastest, most powerful router Netgear had yet to produce...  Specially made for the high demands of Smart Homes. All the hype made it sound like it was going to be AMAZING.<br /><br />Now that I’ve set it up and run a full battery of tests - honestly the best thing I can say about it is it looks cool. 😕<br /><br />I have been working with NETGEAR products for 25+ years so setup was not a big deal.  As with most of NETGEAR’s new products don’t expect much printed material - that’s OK with me...  I downloaded the Nighthawk app and followed the directions - they are fairly straightforward.<br /><br />Restart your modem, plug in your Nighthawk Router, plug Ethernet Cable from modem to router, connect cell to router’s network using the ID and password provided on the sticker on top of the routers plastic cover, return to app.  Here is where things began making less sense.<br /><br />When I return to the Nighthawk app it goes through the process of connecting to my router and I receive an error message: ROUTER NOT SUPPORTED.  Odd, but I’ve learned when installing a new router anything can happen. I exit the app and return, same message.  I exit the app, restart the router, wait and restart the app and it recognizes. Great - I’m in...  no big deal.<br /><br />I update the Firmware, change the network name and password and start checking through the settings.  I notice right away there are very few settings within the app - no security settings tab, no parental controls tab - odd, but I’ve learned NETGEAR tends to move these types of things around when they redesign their apps, so I put that concern to the side.<br /><br />I plug my Ethernet cables into the 1G ports (there are 4 of them) in the back and watch the lights on front illuminate.<br /><br />One of these runs to my computer and once it initialized the internet connection I ran a speed test - I’d tested with my previous router just prior to switch and was consistently benching at 210Mb/s download and 15Mb/s upload.  With the Nighthawk I speed tested at 130Mb/s and 9Mb/s - definitely not what I’d hoped to see but I knew all my smart devices were working on rejoining the network so that could be slowing it down.<br /><br />I decided to give it some time to let everything register on the network. In the Nighthawk app I had 42 devices and about half were still listed as unknown.<br /><br />I let it work for about an hour and it recognized the majority of them...  I ran another speed test - again through my laptop connected via Ethernet through the Nighthawk and this time received 154Mb/s and 11Mb/s.  Still not great.<br /><br />Then I went into my Nighthawk app as it has a speed test feature in there - I try that and receive an error that I must be on the network to run a speed test.  I was on the network.  I exit the app and go back in and receive the message ROUTER NOT SUPPORTED again. Ugh - really???<br /><br />I reboot the router again and then the app recognizes it.  While I’m able to control the router the speed test function does not want to work.  Not a huge issue. I went through the browser on my phone and ran a speed test.  The results were absolutely pathetic. This is the NIGHTHAWK - the router that is supposed to provide blazing fast speeds to WiFi devices and I received results of 5.4Mb/s download and 2.1Mb/s upload - and similar on 3 consecutive tests.  At this point I’m starting to be less than impressed.<br /><br />I decided to log in to the more advanced router settings via my computer.  I had no problem getting in there but to my surprise there are ABSOLUTELY NO PARENTAL CONTROLS.  This is the same company that has sold itself as allowing you to have complete control over every aspect of your home internet.  NETGEAR Genie is no longer available and the NETGEAR Nighthawk panel doesn’t even have a section for parental controls - let alone work with Disney Circle.<br /><br />While there are some advanced security features available within the NETGEAR Nighthawk Router controls on the computer they are anything but user friendly - they are hard to find, hard to set, and less than optimal.<br /><br />As I was discovering all of this and researching these issues in the NETGEAR Community Forums I started receiving notifications from my smart devices that they were losing WiFi signal and then after a minute or two they would reconnect.  This happened with my security cameras, LIFX lights, Wemo switches, and August door locks.  After this went on for about an hour I decided my experiment with the NETGEAR NIGHTHAWK had reached its conclusion.<br /><br />Unfortunately I can’t recommend this router at this time.  While the hardware inside should have this out performing most any other router on the market I found it to be slow and glitchy.<br /><br />⭐️As with all Drew’s Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

5,"Incredible sound quality, super easy set up - GREAT BUY!","I paired this sound bar with our Sony XBR-65X850E 65” TV and it could not have been easier.<br /><br />While my TV would allow me to connect to the sound bar via Bluetooth I opted to connect via the HDMI ARC connection to avoid any sound lag.  In addition to these 2 connection options you can connect via the included optical cable.<br /><br />I followed the instructions - plugged the HDMI cable (not included) into the ARC HDMI port, plugged the sound bar and subwoofer into the surge protector and turned everything on. The TV automatically recognized the soundbar and changed my output.<br /><br />All I had to do was press the “secure link” button on the remote and the sound bar wirelessly linked to the subwoofer without issue.<br /><br />I decided to move the subwoofer to another area of the room - I unplugged it, moved it, plugged it back in and it reconnected without any problem.<br /><br />I was able to pair the system with my iPhone without any issue and the sound is stunning. From the rich bass of the subwoofer, the vibrant midtones, to the crisp highs - every note is clear and distinct.<br /><br />While I have a true 5.1 surround system most of the TV broadcasts are not going to utilize that type of system and the sound is actually richer through a sound bar with a subwoofer.<br /><br />This soundbar can be easily wall mounted using the included template.<br /><br />The entire system is intuitive and user friendly. While many sound systems require hours to hook up and figure out how to use correctly this one is so straightforward. The remote doesn’t have a bunch of excess buttons that you’ll never need or use.<br /><br />In my instance my TV remote was able to control it immediately with no issues.<br /><br />I highly recommend this soundbar for anyone looking for an easy way to improve the quality of the sound from your TV - and you’ll be pleasantly surprised by the rich sound it will deliver regardless of what you play through it.",B07PL6LDP1,B0BYSG291N,AEP4CUO23WOOOEYSJBXWYLLHD5IQ,26:12.1,25,FALSE,1971,4.9,5,5

Purpose is to be able to use either (one on, one off, both on whatever I wish) and see my display on the screen I want to use, for example  If I choose to play a split screen game on the projector it would give a better viewing experience vs playing said game on a smaller screen giving me a smaller split screen without eye strain or feeling that my split screen is too small. I can choose where to watch my media (movies) or gaming on the most convenient or practical screen at any given time for example if I want to play from bed with my wife (fighting game) or if I don’t feel like sitting and rather lay down or lounge from bed to play a game and at the same time snuggle so my wife feels my physical presence.

5,"Works flawlessly, solar power is holding up in tree shade & announces from a long way away.","I have been working out of detached workshop behind my house & set this in front of my house to capture the circular drive. It's not excessively far but it's out of range for a bluetooth device reach. It rings if anything goes through the circle (where the Camaro is) or down the drive past the house. I have tested it by walking at the very edge of the drive & it hasn't failed to alert. I may adjust the settings down before I move the receiver inside because it picks up a lot of cat activity. I didn't realize how many neighborhood cats stroll through my drive early in the morning.<br />I wanted to check this out before I committed to a mounting place so I set it under that oak tree. I thought it might be too shady to maintain the solar power requirements but it's been there a week with no issues. It's so discrete I'll probably just keep it on the rocks & move it closer to the tree. The mounting hardware is pretty nice, though, with a ball-jointed mount that sets up easy since it comes apart & has a lot of adjustment.<br />The receiver has three or 4 chimes & none of them are subtle. It also has another 30 or so songs. Some are holiday themed which could be fun if you were expecting guests for a party. It has some public domain tunes from the Baroque & Renaissance period as well as some contemporary tunes like ""Music Box Dancer"". I currently have it on what sounds like a mariachi band playing ""March of the Toreadors"" from Carmen which is kind of hilarious but I can't imagine what maniac would want to be alerted by that in their house ever.

The quality of the lens and sensor are quite good as well. Not as good as my Sony Alpha camera in a HDMI capture card, but this is a fraction of the cost- more closely resembles a midrange phone camera or gopro in quality.

5,Excellent value!,"I've used Skullcandy products before and always found them to be on the mediocre side of a brand name, so I had what I'd think are pretty realistic expectations for this set. At first I just assumed this was their attempt to break into the now flooded market of inexpensive completely wireless earbud market. And you know what- it turns out that's not a bad thing at all.<br />These offer some impressive fidelity in sound, and unlike some other earbuds which crank up the bass to compensate for being tiny drivers, this actually delivers what I'd consider more realistic sound reproduction. It isn't too bass heavy, but the bass is still there. To be honest, that's something I'm used to hearing only on higher end speakers which don't have anything to prove other than just be good. I forgot how much I just wanted that in a headset. The battery life is pretty decent as well, not amazing but not terrible, slightly above average for what you'd expect for this style of headset. I was actually surprised to find the microphone was half decent as well, as I've never had a good experience with calls on earbuds before (the mic is just too far from your mouth to work well). These aren't going to be as clear separating your voice from the background as, say, a mic that is closer to your mouth (wired or protruding mic arm), or whatever magic Apple has in their airpods to pull off that directional sound, but honestly I was expecting worse and this surprised me.

4,Excellent desktop mic!,"I work in video production and sometimes need to record narration for my work. I have an expensive Rode mic system that I use with my cameras, but I decided to see how a permanent mic setup like this would do. First of all, the amount of equipment you get for the money is insane. The pop guard and arm are pretty awesome, but it turns out my desk didn't have a good place to clamp an articulating arm like that. Thankfully, it also came with a little tripod base so you can have it sit on the desk instead. The USB sound system uses a standard RealTek Audio chip, so it's pretty universally compatible and offers excellent sound quality. In the past sometimes the PC's audio input 3.5mm jack produced extra noise on account of the PSU creating some sort of line humming. With a USB audio interface, that's a non-issue.  I'm impressed with the response of it, it managed to pick up my voice and not a lot of background noise (my computer fan can get loud sometimes!). The only hangup is that I spend some time trying to figure out how to get it accessible to my recording applications. For some reason it kept complaining that the sample rate of the mic didn't match. It did, but the computer kept complaining. I ended up going into Windows sound settings, changing the sample rate, then going back in and changing it back and THEN it worked. It's been good ever since. So, still an excellent mic with impressive quality for the price!",B0829MM1JX,B0829MM1JX,AGDSEYGSA5K664EUHWKV3ARDXO2Q,53:40.2,0,FALSE,1435,4.9,4,5
4,Very comfortable,"I've owned many wireless headphones, so this isn't my first rodeo. I wanted something separate to leave paired with my work computer. Earbuds aren't comfortable for me to wear for long periods of time so over-the-ear style is important. I have to admit, I like these more than I expected to. The ear pads are soft and slow to reclaim their shape like memory foam- this makes them extremely comfortable to wear so I don't mind keeping them on for a good portion of my workday. It also has a rubberized cover for the charging port and 3.5mm jack, which is surprisingly nice to find on a headset in this price range!<br />The sound quality is about on par with what I expected for this price range- that is, it is very good. Not blow-your-mind-amazing like sets that sell for hundreds, but as good if not better than others in this price range. What I didn't like, however, is the microphone quality. Yes, it has a mic, but I'd like to pretend it doesn't. The mic is on the headset by my ears and doesn't seem to be directed towards my mouth. This makes my voice sound distant and muffled, with ambient background noise sometimes on the same level or louder than my voice is. For calls I'd rather use a different headset, but that's OK. This ends up being used paired with my computer rather than my phone. It is pretty decent at passive noise isolation as well, reducing sound around you naturally. The only things I wish were better are the mic and perhaps a physical on/off switch rather than a button, but honestly this is pretty normal for headphones in this price range so I essentially got exactly what I expected.<br />EDIT:<br />I loved these so much, I ended up getting another on in another color for a family member.

5,Fancy! And interesting for lectures/audiobooks,"I'm so happy to see they are still making new brands of wired headphones... lately all the new designs and features have been found in wireless only, and sometimes I just want a good pair of wired 'phones, especially for use with my Quad-DAC headphone jack.<br />They are passive noise cancelling, which basically just means they cushion sound out mechanically with nice big ear muff style rings, as opposed to any kind of digital reverse-sine-wave trickery (which are hit or miss on cheap brands usually), and it has a really interesting ""focus"" mode switch, which changes the EQ of the mix to promote the frequencies used in spoken words better. This is an amazing feature for those of us who listen to audiobooks or lectures, which I do frequently. To be honest, I didn't notice a big difference between having that mode on and off, but it was nice to know someone out there is trying to make products catered for people who want to do more than just listen to music over Bluetooth.<br />The sound quality is pretty good for the price, and the presentation is actually really impressive. The materials feel really premium and even the box it comes in feels super fancy, which might make this a nice gift. I don't expect much out of mics that are embedded in headphones, and this pair didn't change my mind about that. The mic isn't close enough to your mouth to be of much use, picking up more ambient noise around you than you. If they wanted to include that as a feature, they could have made a removable arm like a gaming headset, but they don't need to. This is a good pair of headphones for those of us who just want to listen, which is their ideal demographic IMO.",B082MTV2SN,B082MTV2SN,AGDSEYGSA5K664EUHWKV3ARDXO2Q,11:29.4,3,FALSE,1673,4.5,5,5
4,Very cool!! But not without caveats...,"The Portal is sort of like an Echo Show but with different strengths and weaknesses. There is SO MUCH I could say about this device, some good and some bad, but I'll try to stick to the more important points here.<br />The killer feature, as you may know from their ads, as the way it can automatically zoom in/out and follow faces in a video call. So essentially, you can move around a room hands-free and it will find you and make sure you're in the shot. It's like having your own personal camera man on call.<br />In my experience with it so far, this worked fairly well. Moving left or right, the camera followed me. If more people enter the shot, it will zoom out to get them all in. It isn't without limitations however, and sometimes you'll move too far and it can't see you. Other times it got confused and lost me (if I move out of the frame and back in, that usually fixed it). For the most part, it worked as expected.<br />The sound is actually EXCELLENT considering this is the Mini edition. I was expecting the sound to be more like the Echo Dot, but this has a very large speaker on the rear which is able to drive very impressively deep bass without even approaching max volume. So that was a pleasant surprise.<br />While it has its own ""Hey Portal"" voice commands, it ALSO comes with Amazon Alexa built in. That's where it sort of starts acting like a Facebook-branded Echo Show, playing music, announcements, showing you answers to questions, turning on/off digital things, etc. All the things you want Alexa to do. However, I was sad to find that it isn't considered an Echo device for certain Alexa features, such as multi-room music groups, the Ring doorbell, and probably other Alexa Skills that aren't supported on non-Amazon hardware. So you can't really replace an Alexa Show with this if you need those features.<br />Now, some things that are better than the Echo Show: PRIVACY. I know, this is Facebook we're talking about, but I really like that they included a tab to disable the camera (by covering it up, not just turning it off), microphone, or both. It's like they realized that someone was going to complain they don't want Facebook recording them in their living room and thought ahead to add that. The Amazon devices with cameras don't have a dedicated cover built in. Then there's video calling to people OTHER THAN OWNERS OF ANOTHER DEVICE. The latest Show devices from Amazon have cameras too, but you can only call other Echo Shows or phones with the Alexa app running. The Portal can call Facebook and Whatsapp users, which means I can actually reach other people I'd want to chat with. This isn't a perfect implementation either, however... For Whatsapp, it essentially uses Whatsapp's web functionality behind the scenes to connect to your account. If you use Whatsapp web on your computer, it will log you out of the Portal and you'll need to log back in again after using it. This is an unnecessarily silly extra step. I use Whatsapp web a lot, so we ended up using my wife's Whatsapp account on the Portal to call our family and friends so we wouldn't have to keep logging out and in.<br />Then there's media like Youtube- much like the Amazon Echo devices, Google has decided not to allow an official Youtube app for the Portal either. However, there IS a browser, and you can go to Youtube on it. This makes for an awkward user interface (and not just because you can't control it with your voice), but once the video is up it works fine. It not only plays beautifully full screen, but you can even go back to the home screen and it will continue playing as a picture-in-picture overlay which can be moved around the screen by dragging. That's pretty neat. It's almost like they tried to support Youtube as much as possible without actually having an official interface to abide by Google's rules.<br />Other fun features include Facebook games like Draw Something, Chess, Super Baseball Batting Derby, etc, which you can play against other friends on Facebook or Portal devices. Then there's a bunch of photo effects which are really fun Snapchat-style filters that follow your face in augmented reality-style real time. These features can be used not only in the Photobooth app, but also on ANY call with the device. Then there's my favorite fun feature: Story Time! This feature is sort of like the snapchat photobooth AR-style effects mentioned above, however you read a story and it will animate effects over your face to illustrate as you go. This can be done on the Story Time app on the device locally or in a call to another person. My kids actually really LOVE that feature, and my 2 year old likes to read along with me when we do it. I'll admit they are very cute and sometimes I've laughed out loud when I didn't expect what happens next in the animation being done to me.<br /><br />Honestly, as an Alexa alternative to an Echo Show, it is close but not quite a replacement. As a video chat device, it is better but only if your contacts are on Facebook or Whatsapp. And even then, Whatsapp is only good if you don't use Whatsapp Web. I'd consider it a 3 star device for those caveats, however the Story Time feature as well as the camera that follows you is really quite cool. Add that they considered your privacy with the flap cover and I have to give this at least 4 stars. It really has so much going for it, and I'm hoping they can iron out some of the software kinks to make it even better in the future.",B07XKWKQYT,B07XKWKQYT,AGDSEYGSA5K664EUHWKV3ARDXO2Q,14:32.1,2,FALSE,5476,4.1,4,4
4,Great as an audio player AND headphones!,"I previously owned a black pair of these and liked it enough to get a second pair (in red) for my son. The important feature? TF card reader for self-contained music. My son isn't allowed to have a cell phone in school yet, and finding a good music player that isn't more-or-less a phone is hard these days- but THESE HEADPHONES ARE ALSO AN MP3 PLAYER! I took an old Micro SD card from a discarded phone (about 4GB in size) and filled it up with music files. The headphones have little controls for start/stop/ff/rr, and they can be used like that without being tethered, wirelessly or otherwise, to anything else.<br />Then, in school, he can use it with the supplied aux cable for use in the classroom during computer time, and then at home with our tablets wirelessly over bluetooth. Its amazing how many different roles it plays, and he couldn't be happier with it. The only caveat is that unlike some of my other headphones in this style, this feels a bit weak in build quality, with very shiny plastic that probably will break in my son's backpack eventually. So far so good so I'm still giving it 4 stars, but if the build quality gave me a tad more confidence, I'd give it a 5. For the price I still recommend it, the sound quality is great and it does isolate background noise quite well.",B07K6J8GXW,B07K6J8GXW,AGDSEYGSA5K664EUHWKV3ARDXO2Q,04:36.7,2,TRUE,1297,4.8,4,5
5,"Great for adding more connection points to a QR plate, and also for attaching accessories to a cage!","I have a camera cage that I used to mount directly to my Manfrotto QR plate, but would require tightening up frequently on a job (cage would start to have some play after an hour of use). I realized the cage has two mounting holes (originally designed for attachment to a rail system), so I put a second 1/4&#34; screw in my QR plate, and now I have two points of security which not only prevents needing to tighten the screw, but the slight wobble is nearly non-existent now. I realized afterwards that these screws are not only useful for mounting UNDER the cage, but actually super useful for mounting TO the cage as well!<br />The cage is riddled with 1/4&#34; holes, and in order to tighten an accessory like a microphone mount, the threading on the screw and cage and accessory need to be rotated usually. In other words, if the accessory is mounted in the wrong direction, turning it will also turn the screw, and tightening up the screw might once again move the accessory. These have clearance underneath the threaded part of the screw, so they can actually spin freely once inserted into the cage. That means I can hold an accessory in place while tightening the screw, and it will lock in tight the way I want it to face. Very versatile and useful part of any kit!",B00U9NDH1C,B00U9NDH1C,AGDSEYGSA5K664EUHWKV3ARDXO2Q,45:11.0,1,TRUE,1275,4.9,5,5

My niece has stopped using her locker at school, so she needed a decent backpack for all of her books and such.  I like how this backpack looks small, but once you lift the flap, there is a place for a computer and then a larger area she can put her books, etc.  It really can expand to be much bigger.  I think that this bag has many nice pockets and feature around the bag, along with a place that allows the bag to be plugged in to recharge a phone or other device.  I'm not sure how well it will keep off water, but it's not going to soak straight through.<br /><br />Overall, I think this will be a great bag for my niece.  It should be durable and last well for her.  Plus, it's a nice looking bag!",B07YV5ZW62,B08T7HYR2G,AH74XLC3QBXVC6UCOAQOJH3WJYGA,58:08.8,0,FALSE,856,2.5,4,3

I teach high school, and I have a charging station for my students (trust me, if they're phones are charging, they're not on them), but sometimes the cords disappear. I don't think they mean to take them, but I find that unless someone returns one or gets me a new one, we're left without cords to recharge for half the year.

5,"Perfect--Give Me Sleep Tracking, Which Apple Does Not","For what I wanted, this watch is perfect.  I love that it tracks my sleep, which is desperately needed.  I have fibromyalgia, so I find that deep sleep is hard to find.  While the watch can't make my sleep better, it does track it in a way that helps me work on my sleep times and relaxation so I can get better sleep.<br /><br />Although, like most fitbits, it doesn't perfectly track all types of exercise, I love how it combines with the heart rate to calculate calorie burn.  For instance, I box and swim.  I can leave after an hour and only have 3,000 steps.  On the flip side, I can go for a lazy little walk and get 5,000 steps.  I've learned that not all exercise is the same, and with the heart rate capabilities and calorie calculation, that this fitbit seems to get it a little better.  I don't worry about the steps quite so much, as long as I can keep working on my heart health and calorie burn.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this watch.  It does show text messages I get and alerts me of phone calls.  I'm pretty okay not being able to call from my watch--I don't want to be available every second of my life, but I do like being alerted to things.

If you haven't attached a name to the number, it will just tell you the number of the caller. The tap tap to end the all is very convenient.<br /><br />You can go online and set the buttons and other features to what you wish and update your earpiece using the included mini-usb.<br /><br />Sometimes it doesn't work with the phone, but that is more a function of voice recognition that anything else.<br /><br />It is comfortable to use and the extra earpieces ensure that they fit great.

I know through bitter experience how quickly these suction cups lose their suction; I'm not risking breaking a $200 smartphone. I plug my phone into the power cord, wire it for sound, and while I'm using the GPS listen to podcasts or music. With a little finagling, it's just on the correct angle to see with a quick glance while you're driving.

In my opinion it is just as good if not better due to being rechargeable. My only complaint is the attachment tubes.  Don’t get me wrong the two it comes with work great but there needs to be a tight space, high pressure  tube like you would get with regular canned air…you know that little red tube.  That would make this perfect.  However, you could garage engineer yourself one which is what I will likely do.<br /><br />The duster is simple to use and charges via a USB-A to USB-C cable…USB-C is the blower connect type.  I connected it to an Apple charging block and charged according to the instructions. The tool has an on-off switch and a charging light with will stop “breathing” green when it is fully charged.  It is blue during normal operations and red when dead.<br /><br />The directions are clear enough…the English could be better.  Terminology used is not typical to what you would expect.<br /><br />The air duster is priced slightly high in my opinion but if you clean your computers, keyboard and really any countless number of things it pays for itself quickly.  Works great in the car for your dash and center consoles.  The brush attachment works great on keyboards for getting in between keys.<br /><br />I’m happy with this product.

5,Good for the price and easy to use,"ARTECK HW086MW162 Wireless Keyboard and Mouse combo, still charging that's why there are cables. Pen in the photo for size reference, along with the box it came in.<br /><br />Unboxing was “frustration free” as advertised. I recycled my Logitech cord that connected to my desktop and inserted the USB receiver in it and it worked.<br /><br />I plugged in the Micro USB charging cable to the keyboard and mouse. Only one Micro USB charging cable came with the combo so  I used an extra Android Micro USB charging cable to charge both at the same time.<br /><br />I was able to use the keyboard and mouse in a few moments. My computer automatically updated the files needed in a few minutes.<br /><br />All in all the unboxing and set up was quick and effortless. Now I am going to explore the keyboard.<br /><br />This keyboard has no number side keyboard that makes it smaller.<br /><br />It has a blue function key to access page up, page down, home, and end, on the lower right where the left, right, up, down keys are.<br /><br />Along the top with the F keys are blue function commands:<br /><br />Escape has “Media” – when pressed opened Wave Pad, a NCH program I have installed.<br /><br />F1 has an >/||, which did nothing when pressed<br /><br />F2 has |&lt;&lt;,  which did nothing when pressed<br /><br />F3 has >>|,  which did nothing when pressed<br /><br />F4 has a speaker symbol )x, That mutes sound<br /><br />F5 has a speaker symbol - which lowers volume<br /><br />F6 has a speaker symbol + which  increases volume<br /><br />F7 has a symbol for home, which opens a new browser tab<br /><br />F8 has a symbol of a magnifying glass that opens a search side window and uses Bing for search, when I clicked on one of the search results it opened a new Chrome tab. I had Chrome already opened.<br /><br />F9 has a symbol for a folder, which did nothing when pressed<br /><br />F10 has a symbol for power which turned off my computer. Since I had programs opened my computer asked for permission so I canceled.<br /><br />F11 has “insert” on it which is pretty self explanatory<br /><br />F 12 has “PrtSc” for print screen<br /><br />The action on the keyboard is nice and a lot quieter than the Logitech keyboard I am replacing. The mouse action is good and also quiet.<br /><br />For less than $23 this is a good keyboard and mouse. I never used the number keys on the side of my Logitech keyboard, which needed batteries, as did the mouse that came with it. The mouse had begun to do double clicks when I clicked once and the keyboard “enter” would stay down. That's why I replaced them for this Arteck Keyboard and Mouse combo.

The cable gets tied in knots easily and the tearing of the outer casing which encases the cable just made it worse.

Lastly the padding on the ears tend to wither slowly a few months like flakes of dry skin falling off. Some even got caught around my ear. It would be great if it were easy to wipe down and clean. If you use it as often, cleaning the pads around the ear is something to consider. With headphone sizes, it really depends on the shape/ size of your head.

5,FANTASTIC motherboard!!,"Had issues with installing network driver's since my version of Windows 10 installer was older.  Their first and second tier tech support was USELESS.<br /><br />The issue was that their installers use a .NET package that wasn't installed on my older installer.  Creating a chicken and egg problem, needing to update Windows to install the drivers, which were required for wired or wireless connection.  When running their network driver installers, they would just immediately exist to Windows instead of doing anything or give ANY meaningful error or feadback.<br /><br />This was too much for the ""tech"" support to comprehend.  They kept saying I should return the obviously defective motherboard.  Some actual answer would be: download an offline .NET installer, or download a newer version of Windows 10 installer (free from Microsoft) and burn it into a USB stick.<br /><br />Once I did that, everything has worked BEAUTIFULLY!  Fantastic motherboard!  Typically useless tech support that starts overseas with the immediate answer being ""return to Amazon!""",B08T6HTXF9,B08T6HTXF9,AGYPJI2W4ZRQIEJSAIQCVRG7KIRA,14:46.6,7,TRUE,1062,4,5,4

1,1-5 second delay in response,"This is the worst mouse ever.  While it feels great in your hand, and I wish more mice had rubber on their body, the functionality is horrid.  When you move the mouse, it takes 1 to several seconds before the mouse/receive ""wakes up"".  This happens EVERY time you stop moving the mouse not after a while of sitting.<br /><br />I called their tech support, all they would do is tell me to use newer and different batteries.  So I yelled at them and they sent me another set... and it did the exact same thing.<br /><br />I want a mouse that moves when I move my hand!<br /><br />What's worse?

Great night vision (it was dark but we could still see) and we had no trouble hooking it up to our wifi. The app went right onto our phones and we were notified when there were changes.

1,SIngle wire that came with my SONY STR DE695 box worked better. This antenna clips.,"Clipping (AKA crackle) can be heard in loud passages from local FM classical station. It is as if the signal strength is made too strong - but how could that be? Whereas the simple single wire antenna (which just turned up after our latest move) provided with the Sony box works fine. Could it be that the Bingfu antenna overdrives the 75 OHM FM antenna input?  But how could that be? Or perhaps the antenna itself has a weak internal connection that fails to carry the most strong signal? FM is Frequency Modulation, not Amplitude Modulation so the amplitude stays the same, right? So why clipping? OK. You get the idea. This Bingfu goes into the junk box for reuse as... what.",B08HHXFH98,B0BDXD1FJS,AGLPVZWZG4PAFJYSBSGITVHBLFLQ,04:29.3,1,TRUE,678,4.8,1,5

5,Adds Great Depth To My Dining Room Table,"I have a small dining room table with a granite top.  In the winter we have candles we use as well as during power outages.  The problem is that the table top looks cluttered as we have to put a few things in a small area.  I didn't get this for monitors, but to give a 2nd level to my table and it looks PERFECT.<br /><br />IS THIS HEAVY?<br />This is not overly heavy.  It will hold quite a bit of weight though.<br /><br />IS THIS ADJUSTABLE?<br />This is a set length.<br /><br />WHAT I USE THIS FOR<br />I use this to put the produce dish (Italian Handmade Glass) and the flower vase, the pencil/pen holder, and the other items that we use from either side of the table on to raise it up.  The front of this riser has my decorative candle holders.  The nice part is that our crystal tealight holders slide under the riser so you can see them, but they are easy to reach when they want to be used.  They no longer take up table space.<br /><br />DOES THIS STAY PUT?<br />This stays put nicely.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This riser is not being used for monitors, but it is perfect on my granite dining area table.  It really adds some nice dimension to our table and we all love it.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  Although this would work great for dual monitors, I love it for my use as well.

5,Good Cleaning Kit With Nice Small Tripod,"My daughter and I do a lot of photography of jewelry.  We have had a variety of tripods and camera aids.  This kit seemed like a good one for us.  I got it.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS KIT LIKE?<br />CASE<br />This has a hard case that zips around the edge.  It has a pocket in it to hold things in place and a cupped side to allow for the tripod storage.<br /><br />LENS BAGS<br />There are bags in here which fit small medium or large lenses.  I don't have any lenses yet, but I do have a small light that fits in one.<br /><br />CLEANING CLOTH<br />These come in a zip topped plastic bag.  This is pretty nice and works well as is expected with microfiber cloth for cleaning glass.<br /><br />QUICK RELEASE CAMERA STRAP<br />This comes in a nice package with good instructions in it.  The idea is that this helps stabilize the camera when you are taking a lot of photos.  You can not have to grip the camera so hard so your hand does not get tired too.  If you accidentally slip your grip, it does not crash to the ground.<br /><br />This had a learning curve to it, but I finally figured out how to use it for me where it was helpful.<br /><br />LENS PAPER<br />This paper allows you to clean the lens off gently wet or dry.  The wet means that you use the Altura cleaning solution for greasy heavier prints.<br /><br />PUFFER CLEANER<br />This is a rubberized ball that when you squeeze it, there will be a blast of air that will blow things off of the lenses.  This works quite well when I get a particle on the lens so I don't have to touch it.<br /><br />BRUSH<br />This is when the dust won't blow off the lens or other glass you can gently brush it and then blow it away with the puffer cleaner.<br /><br />EMPTY BOTTLE<br />This is for alcohol or lens cleaner.<br /><br />TRIPOD<br />This is why I wanted this kit the most.  It has an ingenious design to it.  It folds up flat and quite small, yet when you take it apart and tilt it, you can stand it up for close photos, or use it in your hand.  It has rubber on the bottom to keep it put, and it also has a rubberized grip if you want to hold it.  The camera platform tilts, but it locks into place which I love.  This is working great for us taking close up photos of some of the small jewelry we are photographing.  It has come in really handy.<br /><br />What I love is that we can pick it up and use it by hand if we need another angle than the table top one.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This kit is a nice kit.  I got it mostly for the tripod, but the cleaning accessories and the wrist strap make it really nice.  The puffer ball is one of those things that you don't realize you need until you have it.- at least for me.  The case is protective and easy to travel with.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I am happy with this kit.  It has worked better for us than I expected.  We will be using this a lot in the future too.",B07Z8H4HS1,B07KFQFDNB,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,43:01.7,0,FALSE,2898,4.6,5,5
4,"Does Some Things Very Well, One Frustrating Problem","It is important to have graphics tablets in our house.  We have several people in the house who work with graphics so this is a helpful item to have a few of.  Let's take a look at this pad.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This tablet is a nice red color.  It comes with a red cord that plugs into the computer USB port. It has a propretary end on it that goes into the tablet, so you don't want to lose it.  It has a pen with multiple nibs that it comes with.  There is not a stand with the pen.  There is an adequate very simple instruction manual included.<br /><br />There are four press button spots on the top of the tablet. One is zoom in and zoom out, and the others are programmable.<br /><br />PEN PRESSURE<br />This has a pressure sensitivity to it, so if you are using a painting program that is set up for pressure, it will work with this pen.  It says 8000 levels, which is plenty for most projects.<br /><br />BATTERIES?<br />There are not any batteries in this pen.  It works off of the power in the tablet.<br /><br />WEIGHT AND FEEL<br />The weight of it is nice- not too lightweight- feels hefty but not too much.<br /><br />SIZE<br />This is excellent for travel.  The cost is not too much so if it gets lost or broken, you can easily replace it.<br /><br />THE PROBLEM<br />There is one problem with this tablet.  The usable area is such that it is marked out on the tablet.  That is the only area that the pen will work.  Near the upper right hand half of the top edge, however, when you want to use the pen to move or navigate, it goes spastic.  Windows shrink, or things go nuts.  It is really frustrating.<br /><br />WHAT PROGRAM DID WE USE IT FOR?<br />This was used primarily for Krita- a free graphics program.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is an excellent tablet to take with you in your computer tote.  It works well with graphics programs, and is easy to handle and carry.  If it were not for the one VERY frustrating glitch, it would be almost perfect.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Four stars.  The glitch is such that it makes it hard to use this.  If it did not give such problems, this would easily be five stars.",B07RQ67N1T,B07RQ67N1T,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,03:43.3,0,FALSE,2155,4.5,4,5
5,There Is SO Much You Can Do With This Set- It Is FUN!,"Please check in with this review as I plan to expand it greatly as we continue to explore the uses of this fabulous action cam Live View remote kit.  We have been working with this kit as much as we can, but the weather has been horrible so we have been limited on the action filming we can do with it.  I plan to update this review very often in the next month or two as we experiment with the different uses of this camera set with more detail of our experiences.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />The set comes with the camera which looks very small- smaller than a pack of cigarettes.  There is a waterproof case as well as mounts, a wrist screen to monitor and control what you are filming because you won't be able to look through the camera window on the camera itself.  This is designed to use the wrist screen for use.  It is not like a traditional video cam that you look through the screen on the camera as you film.  I am using a microSD card that is 64GB with this camera.<br /><br />DOCUMENTATION AND LEARNING CURVE<br />The documentation was a bit challenging for me to wade through.  It was printed on what looked like recycled paper that is very cheap and not sturdy.  It came in a bunch of different pamphlet forms and other languages too.  I found that this camera was a bit challenging to learn at first. If you are a hands on type of person who tends to jump right into things without reading directions well, you might find a bit of a learning curve with this set.  It is not like a traditional video camera.  It has a few different ways of doing things that I found challenging at first to learn how to operate.  My kids (the techie fanatics of the house) also had a bit of a challenge to operate it at first, so it was not just me.<br /><br />WATERPROOF CASE<br />The waterproof case is easy to get on and off of the camera.  It makes it so that you can film in the rain or the presence of water without any worries.  The enter and hold button is rigged so it operates through the camera case as well as it does on the actual camera.  The previous and next buttons also work well from the waterproof case as they do on the actual camera.<br /><br />LIVE VIEW REMOTE (WRIST BAND)<br />The live view remote as a great picture on it.  It is pretty easy to see despite it being very small, it is sharp and decent enough so you can direct the filming to where you want it to happen.  The camera is controlled from the live remote so that you don't have to be near the camera to make it work.  That means you can use it on your car, helmet, or bike, etc.  The wrist band works well but has to be recharged via mini-usb connection that you can get with the cord that came with the unit.<br /><br />CAMERA<br />The camera was a bit of a challenge to work at first.  The screen has to be rotated through various settings quite a bit at first to get the idea of how it works.  It is black and white and quite basic in nature.  You can use the camera without the wrist band, but it seems to work best together.  You need to have the camera recharged via the USB to mini usb connector cord that comes with the set.  I have not had the camera run down yet so I can not comment on the recharge time.<br /><br />FILM QUALITY<br />This is where I was truly amazed.  I was not expecting this camera to be too great, but I was so WRONG.  The quality of the video we got is fabulous.  VERY high quality HD video and sound for the size camera it is AND used in the waterproof case that we have had to use constantly due to rain we have had ever since we got this set!  We did notice that the sound on the recordings is exceptional too.  It picked up birds singing, all kinds of sounds around but at times footsteps were magnified heavily too.<br /><br />MOUNTING<br />The mount can be transferred from one place to another in various applications.  There are clips, bands, and all sorts of mounts you can use which will allow you to use on helmets with air holes, helmets that are solid, and in a variety of ways.  It is very versatile.  We also have some car mounts that weather permitting we can test out as well and I will update with results.<br /><br />WHAT WE HAVE USED THIS FOR SO FAR<br />So far we have had our daughter strap it on her bike helmet and take it for a ride in the rain, but she could not go far due to the rain being too strong.  We have tested it on a helmet walking around the yard and running.  We have used it to film fish outside a tank, and a variety of settings outside, but have not been able to test it in a very fast moving nature yet.<br /><br />EDITING SOFTWARE<br />So far it has been pretty easy to use and view the videos from the software.  I went online<br /><br />WHAT WE LIKE<br />-filming through waterproof case is fantastically clear<br />-clarity of camera is excellent<br />-mic is very good- almost too good.  Picks up tons of sound(including footsteps which sound rather loud)<br />-extra gear is fantastic so you can slip the mount in and out easily so you can transfer from one place to another easily<br />-wristband is comfortable with great picture and is easy to use when you can not reach the camera<br />-can still use the camera without the wristband although not quite as nicely as with the camera only<br />-editing software is intuitive and easy to use with a small learning curve<br /><br />WHAT WE DON'T LIKE<br />-learning curve at first is a bit bigger than expected<br />-wristband can get hot<br />-instructions can be confusing if you are not a highly technical person<br />-mic can pick up footsteps or other background noises loudly<br />-enter button on the camera is sensitive so if I drop it in a bag, it will turn on even inside the case<br />-putting camera on the side of helmet can get a bit heavy which might bother some<br />-paperwork is cheap and in too many pieces.  I prefer a good solid manual that you don't have to go online to get<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Due to weather, we have not been able to film in as much variety of high action as we plan to do.  As it is right now, we have used it in mildly active circumstances and in a lot of rain. The film quality is AMAZING and the sound is also very good.  The online videos and instructions do help some to understand how to use it and what to do with it.  This camera can switch between video, loops, and photos- all of which can be controlled through the live remote wristband.  If you are a video fanatic, you have a lot of possibilities with this camera set.  If you are a dabbler who wants to have some fun, I still think you can have a lot of use for this set.  This camera has  a lot of possibilities and we plan to continue to explore them as our horrible weather lightens up and we can get back out and do some fun videos.  Hopefully I can upload something to show you the amazing quality of this camera.<br /><br />I highly recommend this action cam and Live View Remote kit.  The quality is excellent and it has a lot of fabulous possibilities to journal trips, capture action accomplishments on film and find new ways to document action and interesting video.  The size and mounts make it possible to do MANY different things and I can see years of fun with this set.<br /><br />As I said in the beginning, I will be updating and streamlining this review as I continue to learn and use this camera set.

My mobile device shows that it does in fact ""fast charge"", which is a bonus and what I expected from the description. The thick braided cable feels like it should hold up to some abuse and should last a good long time. My only gripe with this cable is that the plastic part near the USB C plug is a bit wide and barely fits my phone case. It's not over-sized by any means, but I would like to see more of these after market cables be a bit smaller around the plug area so that they would be more compatible with mobile device cases.

5,Packs a punch for the size.,"I ordered the iHome Alexa Built-in Bluetooth Speaker Portable Wireless Waterproof Rechargeable Lights Up to Music, with Speakerphone, Passive Subwoofer, Carry Strap, Durable Shockproof Floatable Design (IBT158) to replace an old sub par portable speaker that I’ve had for years. The iHome is quite the upgrade with the built in Alexa, better sound and being waterproof. I’ve had this product now for several weeks and would like to share my thoughts.<br /><br />I must say that the sound is pretty good and packs a punch in such a small size. It’s much better than the much smaller and several years old portable wireless speaker that I have been using. In fact there really is no comparison at all. Let’s just say that it is the best sounding portable wireless speaker that I personally have ever owned. My daughter who “borrowed” the older speaker some time ago (and she never gave it back) keeps asking to ""borrow"" the new iHome as she says, “it’s louder and sounds WAY better”. I absolutely agree with her. Plus the lights on this thing are a nice touch, and there are options (via a button on top) to cycle through and change the color options or turn them off.<br /><br />Setting up the iHome for Bluetooth and Alexa was easy and very straight forward, and there has been no issues whatsoever. We are mainly an Android household however my oldest daughter uses an iPhone and everyone has had the same great experience. So far my only complaint is that the Bluetooth connectivity distance isn’t the greatest but with that said, none of my Bluetooth devices really have much range in our home so I am not going to knock points off for that. The sound out of this little guy makes up for the Bluetooth short comings and the bonus of Alexa being packed into this as well as the waterproof features make this a great value for the selling price.<br /><br />One thing worth mentioning is that to use Alexa, you can’t just say “Alexa” to activate her. You do have to physically press a button on the iHome speaker to access her, which isn’t a huge deal breaker, but because of this, you can’t use other Alexa devices to make an announcement and have it broadcast to the iHome speaker. Being fairly new to the Alexa and smart home world, I am not going to hold this shortcoming against the iHome device. It actually makes sense that with this being portable, you wouldn’t want to have Alexa always listening and drain the battery while on the go. Speaking of Battery life, it's decent but not spectacular by any means. This is pretty subjective however as usually when I use the iHome, I'm listening to it at a pretty high volume ;)<br /><br />Another observation is that this uses micro USB to charge, and I really would like to see more devices using the newer and better USB C charging capabilities.<br /><br />As far as the “waterproof” capabilities go, I must report that I have yet to float the device in a pool or let the kids play with it outside while running through the sprinklers. I know that it says it’s waterproof and it absolutely looks like it would hold up to getting wet as it is very well built, rugged and quite solid, but I don't want to risk ruining this new toy that the whole family has been enjoying so much.",B07NSP78DF,B07NSP78DF,AFLBMDZDIPCHMWWA7CXQXITPBJKA,43:45.6,5,FALSE,3232,4.4,5,4

3,On the fence still...,"First, let me say I purchased the Powershot 510 and the Powershot 310.  The 510 is a much more solid camera and a lot less plastic than the 310.  I think my two largest complaints and frustration comes with the touch screen and the 12 power zoom.  The touch screen drains the battery faster than my other Canon Powershot cameras and the zoom is incredibly difficult to get stable when at full 12 power and my pictures haven't turned out as well as I would like at that distance.  Overall, I really didn't like the Canon Powershot 310, so I am on the fence as to whether or not I will keep this one.  I have a few more days to think about it.  For now... here is a more detailed list of pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Takes incredibly good photos with regard to color.<br />- Easy to use.<br />- The vivid setting is great for flowers and fall colors.<br />- I love the fisheye effect without having to carry around my Canon DSLR camera and lenses.  I also love having the wide angle.<br />- The miniature setting is kind of fun to use.<br />- Feels incredibly heavy and solid, unlike the new 310.<br />- Fits easily in my purse and pocket.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Can't stand having finger prints all over the screen when I go to take my picture.<br />- Touch screen drains the battery pretty quickly over the other Canon Powershot cameras.<br />- When zooming out, it is very difficult to keep it steady.<br /><br />Not sure what to order if I send this one back.  So, I am still on the fence, as I am partial to Canon cameras over Nikons.  The red color is not as it is shown in the picture.  It is more of a rust/burgandy color of red... it has a bit more brown to it, but I actually like it.<br /><br />UPDATE: 12/12/2011 - I ended up sending this one back and kept the Canon 310.  I am really glad I did.  I get a great battery life and when I compared the photos on this camera vs. the 510, the photos had better color and looked a lot more crisp from the 310.

I now have it connected with the auxiliary input cable that came with it. When it works it is better than the speakers that are on the TV.<br /><br />For some reason it gets weird settings where all you hear is music and you can barely hear the words mumbling in the background.

Folding in and out (or z-fold) is also about what you'd expect, no nasty surprises.  And when you're typing, you once again get just what you expect from a keyboard.  I find the touch and responsiveness to be pretty good -- the only trouble I have is adjusting to such a small keyboard, but that's also to be expected, it's not a flaw in the product.  The various function keys at the top of the keyboard are pretty handy as well.<br /><br />I haven't tried the feature that allows you to charge your phone from the keyboard's battery, I don't need it.  But it's a nice idea.<br /><br />Very minor criticisms:  (1) It should have come with its own charge adapter, not just cables.  (2) A way to carry a stylus might have been nice.

I've used the Samsung drives in the past, and have found the management software (Samsung Magician) to be very useful.  Crucial's Storage Executive doesn't really come close.<br /><br />Quick background:  Converting your computer to run from an SSD instead of a normal rotating hard-drive will definitely give you a Wow! level performance improvement.  If you're reasonably technical, there are several guides to be found on the web that will help.

4,Great protective cover for a Galaxy Tab S4,"I purchased this for a basically new Galaxy Tab S4 tablet I purchased a couple months prior, in order to protect it from damage and incidental environmental exposure. I am quite content with it - the frame is quite rigid, protecting the tablet from flexing. The front cover isn't flimsy, and the material feels like it is high quality, with strong, distinct stitching. The case allows the tablet to be charged without issue. The internal pen holder - for me - is indispensable, as otherwise I would never have the S-pen and consequently never use it.<br /><br />In terms of positioning, the cover is fine. Even sitting back on a recliner-like chair, I can find a position which is comfortable for viewing. It also works fairly well on a table. In terms of weight, it adds a bit to the tablet, I'm guessing 20% or so. Considerable, but the S4 isn't all that light to begin with and you'll have trouble beating this case's weight without sacrificing rigidity or durability. In terms of aesthetics, it is on point - hard, clean lines, subdued texturing and coloration, quite refined.<br /><br />As for complaints, not many. It is hard to get the tablet out of the case once you put it in there, so make sure you have your SD and/or SIM card installed before you pop it in. It takes some time to get used to how the stand works, and it isn't the best at staying upright if you are moving things around on the table, though I have only had it slde flat a couple times. That's about it.<br /><br />This isn't a case you want to use for a child or teenager - probably - or for a tablet you intend to bring out into the weather or while traveling in less-than-ideal environments. They have tablets cover for that purpose. This one is better for people bringing the tablet around the house, leaving it on the kitchen counter, maybe taking it by car to the office and back in a padded sleeve - I bought ASIN: B07Z4JZFWF, which works well for that purpose.<br /><br />Would recommend.",B07GF8K8ZW,B07GF8K8ZW,AHNOLQG5SZLLNGPOF3GAVRMQMQDQ,57:32.5,0,TRUE,1973,4.5,4,5

Fits regular 9V, doesn't *quite* fit the lithiums, not a problem for most people.<br /><br />Also great little boxes for spare parts, such as fuses if you are using a multimeter.

It is a true leather, has a soft black lining, allows for four viewing heights, is well made, and didn't come with extraneous packaging or literature.  The Kindle slips into elasticized corners of a plastic material and the elastic used to hold the closed case together is very soft.  I especially like the way the case actually slips into the slots when it is used as a stand.

5,These Open Back Headphones Deliver,"If you're looking for closed headphones, the Sennheiser HD 598 Audiophile Headphones with High-Gloss Burl Wood Accents are NOT for you.  On the other hand, the open back design of these headphones is perfect for my needs, providing clear and consistent sounds.  With an open back headphone, you can hear outside sounds and what you're listening to can be heard by others around you.  The sounds through these are clear and true, making them a great asset when listening to spoken word as for transcription purposes.  Because they are so true, when hearing some older or poorly mixed tracks, the obvious difference in location recordings can often be jarring.  I can get by that since these are wonderful when used in true stereo or hifi, well-mixed applications.  They really do mimic a hifi speaker system in the small space of my head!<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the burl-look in cars, and I'm also not crazy about the burl-look of these headphones or the beige band.  Since I'm not looking at the headphones but rather listening through them, it's not an issue for me.  The velour covered ear pads are thick, comfortable and have shown no signs wear since I've been using my set.  I've spent many hours at a sitting listening through these and have yet to have a problem or complaint with the fit, feel, or sound.  The band is rather easy to adjust, the pads tilt smoothly and once I've settled in, I've not needed to readjust unless I've removed the headphones.<br /><br />I've used Sennheiser microphones in film and video production, both in the field and studio, having trusted them for providing great sound for a recording, but I've not used Sennheiser earphones until the HD598's in the Audiophile series.  I wish my studio headphones were as comfortable as these, but then I'd need a closed set!  With a long 10 foot cable, I'm able to move more than a couple steps and if I want to extend the distance, I can add on a longer cable.  Coming with an attached gold plated phono (1/4"") plug and a gold plated mini (1/8"") adapter, I'm set for use on laptop, ipod, amplifier, television or professional equipment.

This Linksys E1200 router is not worth even a quarter of the $49.99 price!,B004T9RR6I,B004T9RR6I,AELXZY5KE5RVD5LCBAK6IZ77SNXQ,24:41.0,0,TRUE,727,3,5,3

I looked at other high end slim backpacks but the pockets and design were less than I wanted. I needed a hybrid: slim, professional design, but with lots of places to put my stuff. When I travel, I carry a large laptop, sometimes two, power supply(s), a hub, notepad, kindle, iPad, and then a cable per device to charge and a USB power hub. I also like to take things that every other person might take on travel: snacks, light sweater/scarf. Believe it or not, this bag holds it all. I've been using it daily for work and love it. It did feel a little heavy out of the box when I received it, but it hasn't been a problem. The straps are really solid and the back is nicely padded (the laptop compartment). The removable crush-proof AC-Adapter garage makes a difference. I think this helps better distribute the weight because AC Adapters can be pretty hefty. I saw other reviews mentioning the bag's weight but decided to give it a try anyway and I'm glad I did. It's only 3lbs, 6 oz. I don't think you'll get a lighter bag with better construction.

1,HORRIBLE CAMERA,"I got this camera from my kids for christmas.  I was sooo excited.  As I had wanted a camera for some time.  They picked it up at Target during the sale, so they had not been able to get reviews in advance.<br />WELL.  I took this on literally a once in a lifetime trip:  The Great Wall in Beijing<br />I took it out of the box, got extra batteries, packed it and off I went-Carry on only.<br />Got to Beijing, took a few pictures around town, feeling pretty comfortable in how to use it given I didn't want to mess up when I was at the Great Wall.<br />No issues, although the initial batteries did not last more than 35 pictures, but alas, I had anticipated that and had more!<br />(actually I did have some times where the camera was irratic and would and would not take pictures as it said the battery was low)  I put in new high use batteries.<br />Finally the tour bus gets us to the ""wall"".  I get out all smiley and ready to walk the Great Wall.<br />Got ONE picture.  I am not kidding.  ONE.  Even with the new batteries, it would turn on but have a blank screen-white and nothing else.  Took batteries out, put them in again just in case I messed up.  Nothing.  Had my husband try.  Had my 14 yr old son try.  NOTHING.<br />I come home with ONE picture of the Great Wall on my camera, 5 on my husbands Iphone.<br />DO NOT BUY.  HEARTACHE.  HORRIBLE<br />Not only did I not get Great Wall pictures, but my kids were sad that they had gotten me a bum camera when they were so excited to have gotten me one.  Too late to return of course, so I guess I have to add to the garbage sites and that does not make me happy either.",B0069SBXMQ,B0069SBXMQ,AGBCFOG34RQCYVWN6YK7SZQH7PFQ,39:45.0,4,FALSE,1631,4.3,1,4

4,Small radio,"This radio is a lot smaller than I thought it would be.  I guess I've watched too many movies, because I was expecting something much larger, more military, like in a movie where a group of soldiers doubletimes it to a an evac point and then uses their radio to call in a chopper.<br /><br />This radio is tiny by comparison, it's smaller than the freebie Clinique bag I got from Nordstroms.  The radio itself is very lightweight too, which I would have already known if I'd taken the time to read the product description.<br /><br />Also, it's a bit quiet.  My husband and I had to strain to hear it, but since it is so lightweight, it wouldn't be much of a problem to carry it close to your ear.<br /><br />The screen is tiny, but easy to read and once you've turned the radio on, it doesn't crackle and shoosh roaming through stations to find a live one.  You have to manually turn it to the station you wish to listen to.  The reception was pretty good, we live in a flat area and get a lot of radio stations, but I'd imagine that if you took this hiking, you might have trouble receiving anything, the antenna is a bit short.<br /><br />The crank seems a little flimsy, I imagine that repeated cranking would cause a stress fracture that would eventually break, rendering the radio mostly useless.  We haven't tried charging this with solar power yet, it's been super overcast here, but as soon as we have a sunny, rain free day, I'll give it a go.<br /><br />Pretty good radio, I don't have any other emergency radios to compare this to, so I don't know if its flimsier than it's competitors.",B00KSFDE6Y,B00KSFDE6Y,AGLTXNHKNRY5SAZ62RG76WRBN75A,45:15.0,0,FALSE,1598,5,4,5

3,Very heavy. Too heavy for my comfort level.,"Likes<br />Good adjustment features.<br />Clarity 7/10 to 8/10.<br />Easy adjustment to match your face size.<br />Nice case.<br /><br />Dislikes.<br />Too heavy for my comfort level.<br /><br />I last used binoculars on a trip to Alaska. I had inexpensive compact binoculars, which had a more limited range than these, and with less clarity.  I was using them to look straight up the mountains to watch the amazing white goats.  They were very light and my arms never became tired.  Those are the ones I would take if I went again.  These binoculars are superior, with the major exception being they are just not comfortable to hold.  I couldn’t watch those goats for more than a few minutes, with these binoculars.<br /><br />These will probably work great on a tripod, for a very muscular person, and certainly for viewing an object for a few minutes.  If you have a stationary object to rest it on, that would help. Though one reviewer mentioned using a tripod, I wasn’t able to locate a place to screw in the tripod.<br /><br />The price of these seems to fluctuate quite a bit.  These can be a good buy for the right person.",B0B125RWNX,B0B125RWNX,AGVAFSJVSPGXMBKR4N6PEOAXNGFA,32:48.6,0,FALSE,1130,4.8,3,5

Kudos.<br /><br />This furniture policy unlike their appliance polices, does not extend any manufacturers’ warranty.  It is an accident policy only.

Diagnosed over the phone.  Part sent directly to my home.  Repairman came next day. Fixed four days after initial failure.  Very impressed.<br /><br />On this item, Square Trade cancelled this warranty due to a mistake.<br /><br />I purchased a Sonos Soundbar at the military exchange.  I then purchased this warranty on Amazon as it is listed separate from the main item.  I provided the receipts to Square Trade and they told me I was covered.  A week later they contacted me.  It turns out even though it is listed as a separately available purchase for my device, you must purchase the covered item from Amazon.  They said they sell it at a very low price based on volume sales on Amazon.  The Square Trade Direct price is much more expensive.  It is a great bargain when purchased on a Amazon.  Not only price, but a longer warranty.",B008I64N2Y,B008I64N2Y,AGVAFSJVSPGXMBKR4N6PEOAXNGFA,16:46.8,1,TRUE,964,4.6,5,5
5,Nice improvement.  Perfect fit.  Feeling of security.  See installation video before doing anything.,"This is our fifth OtterBox, dating back to my I phone 3GS.  This version has a major improvement,<br /><br />Pros.<br />  1.  The plastic screen finally looks good.  There was always a gap between the screen and the I Phone glass.  That gave it a cheap look. That gap is gone.  The plastic screen goes flush against the I phone glass and looks much better.<br />  2.  We have never dropped our phones, but this case gives us a great feeling of security.  At $ 800 or so per phone, it's really cheap insurance.<br /><br />Cons.<br />  1.  Installation and removal.  We don't install these often enough to remember how to do it.  The case comes assembled, and must be disassembled before use.  Couldn't remember how to disassemble it. I finally went to You Tube to watch a video.  Search term: &#34;installing an OtterBox case.&#34;  A comment to the video jogged my mind.  It's like changing a bicycle tire.  I used a miniature screwdriver to separate the rubber from the case at the corner.  Nothing sharp.  The rest of the rubber came off easily.  The plastic parts separated easily enough.  Place the phone inside, after cleaning both screens.  Click the plastic pieces together, then place the rubber on.  Keep massaging the rubber until it fully envelopes the plastic tightly.  Had a few gaps at first.<br /><br />  2.  Takes away the looks of the I Phone.  Steve Jobs must have hated OtterBox.<br /><br />  3.  Apple has a neat stand up charger for about $ 35.  I bought one.  OtterBox was late to the party with the OtterBox 6 plus,  so I purchased the Apple 6 Plus leather case. Not much protection, but looks sharp.  Worked great with the Apple stand up charger. Looked sharp together.  Unfortunately, neither the OtterBox, nor any case that recesses the apple phone insert will work with this charger.  Only a very thin shell will work with the charger. Back to using the regular Apple cord.  I also have the OtterBox Strada for my I Phone 6.  I like it.  Although much thinner than the Defender, it doesn't work with the stand up apple charger either. Looks great.  Many compliments.  For those that don't like to carry a wallet all the time, the Strada has a pocket that contains both my license and one credit card.  Great for trips to the gym.  My wife has the Defender.",B00Z7SX51Q,B00Z7SX51Q,AGVAFSJVSPGXMBKR4N6PEOAXNGFA,28:45.0,3,FALSE,2283,3.4,5,3

Every other protector out there has given me frustration with bubbles.<br /><br />A number of one star reviews mention the grid effect.

5,Major Upgrade Especially if You Own a Vizio TV!,"My wife and I decided to upgrade our entire living theatre setup this February. We purchased this soundbar for $798 and a Vizio P759-G1 TV for $1234. The best part of this setup is that the Vizio TV and soundbar support “common mode” transport of Dolby Atmos. This means that our Apple TV 4K can be plugged into any of the five HDMI ports and this soundbar will receive (compressed) Dolby Atmos. The majority of our movie watching happens on the Apple TV 4K with iTunes movies that have Atmos soundtracks. This form of Atmos is already compressed (Dolby Digital Plus) so we aren’t really losing any quality. We love our new setup in our smallish living room. The 10” subwoofer is also a huge improvement over the 8” woofer in the Vizio SB4551-D5 soundbar we had previously. The passive radiators inside the bar also help with its musicality. There’s actually a lot of detail in the mids versus other bars. Vizio has always made very “musical” soundbars, but this one is exceptional. We moved that system to our bedroom. Now we have full surround sound in two rooms (one with full Atmos!) and we couldn’t be happier.",B07GTQWMYQ,B07GTQWMYQ,AH3SJL3HQM4RMECRSKCBENR65WWQ,16:35.4,1,FALSE,1115,4.4,5,4

The light portion of the alarm is great, since it will either disorient your attacker temporarily (if the sound didn’t already get them to run away), and let people know where about you are.<br /><br />It’s also a very pretty color, and the wrist lanyard is nice. I threw out the black carabiner it came it’s because it seemed really cheap and there was a funky brown goo on it.<br />Besides the funky carabiner, this alarm is worth its value and I’m looking to get more for my family!",B0BCR4HY37,B09Y8GDTNR,AFAQZ732NOPHGMU3OMFA2VXILXQA,18:12.2,1,FALSE,856,4,5,4

5,Bought used and highly recommend,"TLDR: Used or not, the newest base kindle is a great buy for anyone looking for a good e-book reader. The features of the higher end models are nice to have, but by no means need to have. The money you save on the device can be put toward more books to actually read, which, at the end of the day, is what we are all here for.<br /><br />This is my second time buying a used kindle device (the last one was an Oasis).  I have to say, it is my preferred way to buy Kindles. The Kindle I purchased this time was in Used-Acceptable condition (I believe that is the lowest condition amazon warehouse sells used products- the rest go to woot or get recycled).<br /><br />When I unboxed it, I found that it had very minor scratches on the bezel and back- visible from only certain angles - all just superficial surface scratches, nothing gouged into the plastic. Even if it cost more (I paid less than $40 for it)  I wouldn't be annoyed in the least to find the very faint, surface scratches on this device. I have zero regrets and would do it again. Not only that, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that special offers was turned off on the device despite the fact that it was sold as 'ad supported' (it is likely the previous owner had turned them off and amazon just never turned them back on before selling the device - I wouldn't expect all used device to have it turned off, but it was a nice bonus to see that I got lucky and saved the $20 removal price).<br /><br />Device works just like new and I am very happy with it. This is my second Kindle (and 7th e-ink device). My last Kindle was the second version of the Oasis. I traded that in to get the discount on the new paperwhite, but I am still waiting on it to ship (looks like I will get it in Late November)- hence the purchase of a cheap device to have on hand. This version of the Kindle has most of the features of the second version of the Oasis minus:<br />-Dark mode - I liked this mostly because I found the automatic light settings to be too bright most of the time and I liked to read in bed.<br />-Auto-light settings - Often too bright and I would manually adjust it anyway (or my hand would cover the light sensor and the device would suddenly get bright).<br />-Page buttons - Nice to have, but definitely not a need to have. The way I hold my reading devices is usually from the bottom anyway, so the touch turn is the most ergonomic.<br />-Waterproof - I tried reading in the bath once. It wasn't for me. I don't really sit and read in places I am going to get wet.<br />-Resolution - 167ppi may sound low, but when compared to mass market paperbacks, printed on recycled paper, I would say the text looks about the same - perfectly legible. Plus, you can change the font type and size to suit your taste, so it is superior to most printed text.<br />-Option for cellular data - Looks like Amazon may be phasing this out since it isn't available on the newest paperwhite. I rarely used it, but it was nice to know that I would be able to buy a book on the go without having to connect to public wifi if I really wanted to.<br /><br />The current Oasis and Paperwhite also have warm lights in addition to the normal lights (which is the main appeal of the paperwhite for me). Again, not a deal breaker for a device, but it is nice to have.",B07978J597,B07NPK4PY4,AGAT223JYYC4N44BDQOUUSY67Z5A,26:54.1,5,TRUE,3315,2.7,5,3

1,Thanks for the refund Besteker.  Sorry your camera is no good.,"I have to second all the negative reviews on this camera.  I bought it because of the 24 MP and the fact that it had a remote control.  After using it to record a baseball game, I could not watch the video.  It was horrendous.  And the remote didn't work either.  It is possible I got a defective unit, and to their credit, Besteker issued me a refund.  But for anybody considering this camera, take a look at the Sony 5MP MHS-CM1 webbie which shoots in 720P and shoots in MP4.  For a little budget camera, the Sony has been great for me.  Good, clear video.  Easy to use.  And even on my 65&#34; 4k TV, the Sony looked sharp.  The Besteker was supposed to be an upgrade to that camera.  Looks like I'll have to keep on looking.... or maybe buy another Sony.  In all honesty, don't even consider this camera.  Have you ever heard of Besteker?

Now I can finally get all of my computer equipment and electronics plugged into the wall, and behind my desk instead of using the bulky power strip that sits on the floor, This power strip uses one outlet and has a center screw for added stability.

5,WHY this IS or ISN'T the Riser for You,"I looked at a LOT of risers before choosing this one.<br /><br />I don't have a huge monitor, about 22 inches, but it is on a ROUND BLACK stand and so I wanted a stand that it looked good on.<br /><br />My experience:<br /><br />ADJUSTABLE! - THIS was a BIG deal to me because I wasn't sure EXACTLY how high I wanted it (I have an adjustable computer chair re height).  I have degenerative discs in my neck and while they don't bother me a lot, I realized constantly kind of looking DOWN at my monitor wasn't helpful and I wanted something more eye level.  I put it on the LONGEST setting so it was up high enough.<br />IT'S PERFECT and that's partly why I chose this one, it was adjustable.<br /><br />SUPER EASY to put together - you take the little caps off the screws on the platform and then just screw the legs in and really easy to adjust whatever height you need.<br /><br />STURDY! - No bends in the middle and while my monitor isn't that big or heavy, seems it could withstand something fairly heavy.<br /><br />LOOKS! - I love how the stand of my monitor just blends in with the modern looking black riser.<br /><br />HAS VENTILATION HOLES - for those wanting to put their desktop on it, this could be important that it has the holes in it.<br /><br />BOTTOMLINE:  I got it when it was two dollars off, so a total of about $15, but would have gladly paid more because it's perfect for what I wanted.",B07H4DMLVH,B09PY2KCZF,AEZIW242EBVLBV24LA7FKYVN7YUQ,33:39.9,2,TRUE,1410,4.1,5,4
5,PROS/CONS  Good things come in SMALL packages!,"PROS and CONS and why I chose this one.

EUREKA!<br /><br />PROS:<br />PACKAGING - I was concerned re how it would arrive, but my mother said it was in heavy foam packaging. Came in perfect condition.<br /><br />SIZE - PERFECT SMALL RADIO for her night stand.  MUCH smaller than the 22 inch dimensions it shows in top description!  It's small enough for a SMALL nightstand.<br /><br />SET UP - MY mother had no problem setting it up or figuring out knobs.  This is as easy as radios from the '60's.  Basically a couple knobs and a switch to go back and forth between AM and FM<br /><br />SOUND -  I was on the phone with my mother as she dialed through various stations and GREAT sound.

The surface feels great to the touch and looks great. Installation is fairly straightforward. Just be sure the surface is clean. You don't want to risk lifting the screen and having it crack. The company offers 100% guarantee, so that alleviates the stress of breaking it by accident if it does happen to crack over time.<br />I'm interested to see how this holds up over time, but so far it seems of very high quality.

Usually leads to overshooting my choice. Other than that, it fully replaces three remotes including a Vizio soundbar which didn't work with any other programmable universal remote.

4,Well worth the $30.,"I would like to start with. 3 months owning the watch.  I am in no way affiliated with this product or company.  I am a former FF/EMT- that will come towards the BP, HR, 02 and sleep tracker that many in the reviews discredit. First off, people don't understand that you have to read instructions.  I know my normal vitals from day to day activities. If you raise the watch to heart level.  It is very accurate- from my watch.  From my sleep studies- this watch is very accurate.  I originally purchased this watch to be able to control music without taking out my phone and tell time. That was worth $30 to me.  I have found the blood pressure,  oxygen,  heart rate,  sleep tracker to be accurate.  My complaint is sometimes I need to open (and close) the app on my phone in order for it to connect data to control music- inconvenient for what I bought it for.  But with the rest of the conveniences on the watch, I'm still very happy with the purchase.  I haven't tested the exercise tracker- no need, I just exercise.  STEP COUNTER IS INACCURATE AT ABOUT THE RATE OF DOUBLE THE STEPS. App is easy to use.  Like I said- sometimes I need to open and close the app on my phone to connect data that should already be connected. Shower, submerged- no problem.  I work active general contractor construction, still no scratches.  Battery holds up to a 5 day charge on normal use, screen brightness 4/5. $30?

2,Disappointed,"First, I'm not sure if it's Dell's fault or who is to blame but this pc had a battery that was not recognized by the pc itself. It wouldn't charge and, therefore, was useless. This warning came on as soon as I turned the pc on and I couldn't find anything online to indicate what, if anything, I could do. I figured it was a glitch so I continued to set things up, get a little used to Windows 8.1, etc. Took a break, shut it down, and came back a couple of hours later. I could NOT get back on the pc. The log on screen was completely locked, the touch screen wasn't functioning, the actual keyboard wouldn't work, nothing. I spent time on my old pc searching for answers online, even went to the Dell site to find that I would have to be online with the new pc for any diagnostic to be run. Finally decided enough was enough and decided to contact Amazon who approved returning the pc for a refund. Amazon customer service is the absolute best. This didn't deter me from buying a Dell and, as a matter of fact, I ended up using my husband's discount to order one directly from Dell itself. It's a little bit different configuration but I feel better getting it directly from them. I've worked on Dells for many many years and I really like them.

It moves around in the usb slot and doesn't feel like it is totally attached to the microscope. In fact, the first time I inserted the part into the scope, I thought something broke.

5,"Good Sound, Comfortable, Fantastic Buy","As other reviewers have noted, they're a tiny bit flat in the mids, but that can easily be tweaked with a little EQ adjustment. The materials seem robust, and there's no 'feedback' from rubbing the cord. There is a noticeable difference in sound quality on the two cords; the longer, coiled cord is good. The other, not so much. I really like the look of them, they look like they cost two or threes times as much. I have pretty large flappers, but the ear cups are generous and I can, with periodic adjustment, wear them comfortably for several hours.

The on-board video didn't seem to work at first, so I tried the GeForce GT 1030 and that worked great. I didn't go back to trying the on-board video. I did need to make some updates to Ubuntu to eliminate some weird crashes (see howtogeek article on installing version 5 kernel and linuxconfig article on getting the latest nvidia drivers).<br /><br />After updating my bios and setting the memory to 3200Mhz (it incorrectly detected 2400Mhz), the multi-core Geekbench came out ~10% higher than the normal score for my cpu (no OC), so MSI is doing something right.

4,Great camera except for indoor no flash shots,"First, the bad: indoor, no flash pictures are poor.  We took about 60 pictures this weekend for my brother's graduation, about half inside with no flash, and only 4 of them came out okay.  Even the ""good"" ones weren't particularly sharp when I reduced them to 800x600.  We mostly took pictures of people; any movement on the part of the subject or the camera made the picture very blurry.  Guess it's using a slow shutter speed to compensate for the low light, though I'm surprised that it's as bad as it is!  Though, this is the only digital camera that I've used, so it might just be that I had high expectations<br />Besides indoor no flash shots, this camera is great.  It's pretty.  It has some weight to it which makes it feel more solid.  It's small---it easily slips into a jeans or shirt pocket.  The lithium battery that comes with the battery is great---it lasts forever.  The camera comes with a charger.  I used the camera off and on over the weekend (~60 pictures) and didn't run out of battery.  Outdoor shots are sharp and the colors are good.  The memory is pretty speedy.  I transferred over 100 meg worth of pictures in just a few minutes.  Oh, and since the battery is so good, you don't need to worry about buying one of those special download hookups.  Just plug the USB cable into the camera and start downloading!<br />One thing that I particularly love (being the computer geek that I am) is that I can mount the camera as a USB drive under linux, no special software needed.  I just ""mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt/usb"" and copy the files over.  No hassling with Windows!<br />In summary, if you don't mind using the flash for indoor pictures, this is a great little camera, well worth the money.",B000087KY8,B000087KY8,AGEKTLY6LFRPQWPPFUSKIZ3Q27YQ,35:13.0,19,FALSE,1720,4.9,4,5

The part that joins the cable to the end is reinforced really well , better than any of the other cables Iv bought . It’s made to bend at that point unlike other charging cables . This is by far better quality than any Iv ever used. I think it’s my favorite iPhone cable out of ever single one Iv ever owned in the history of owning Iphones . I’d recommend this to anybody needing a quality iPhone cable and a great gift for anybody with an iPhone . I scanned the insert and was taken to a fb messenger page that asked if I needed a replacement or refund or something else. It was pretty cool that they have customer service setup for instant support . It had a 1 year warranty and the card included in the box says I can extend it to a 2 year warranty. My cords have never lasted a year let alone 2 years . I can’t believe they offer instant resolution and replacement. It makes me feel like Iv ordered a very reliable cable . I can’t wait to see how long this lasts and will update his long it lasts me . Update : I got a reply when I scanned the warranty card and the reply was that my 1 yr warranty was extended to 2 years ! So if you buy this I’d recommend scanning the warranty card and extending your warranty to 2 years . Iv been using this cable in my car for a while now and it has made it so much easier to plug in my phone to use apple car play and be able to move it around as needed.

4,Best of the budget earbuds,"I'm on my third set of budget earbuds and these are far and away the best ones that I've had. The design allows for them to stay on my ears whether I'm running or doing lifting. The battery life is pretty good, I typically use them for between 60 and 90 minutes at a go and I only charge the case every week to 2 weeks depending. The absolute best thing about these is they don't lose connection when you walk more than 7 ft away or when they're sync to your wrist and you only have the right earbud in. That was a common problem when using my garment on my left hand and running with only the right earbud in and other brands. But this one keeps connection the whole time when I'm running no issues. The sound isn't amazing, but it's still good enough that I would only notice it if I grabbed another much more expensive set of headphones to compare it to.

3,The Cable/Satellite Terminator that Performs Updates during NFL Playoff Games,"Overall it works well.  And I love the no-monthly fee part of this unit.  Though the unit runs slowly, as if it runs on a 1990-circa CPU.<br /><br />The setup was super easy and straight forward.  Picked up about 70 channels in the Denver market.  (Didn't know there were that many.)  Though half of them didn't actually broadcast anything.  Then I had to narrow it down to about 10 channels that broadcast meaningful contents.  It took a long time to download and apply updates during the initial setup.  Took about 2 hours.<br /><br />The menu navigates slowly.  Each action took about 3-5 seconds for the unit to finish.  The OnePass makes recording a series far more complicated than necessary.  I have to jump through many hoops to make it happen.  On my cable remote, I can simply press the record button twice to setup a series recording.<br /><br />I really like how seamlessly TiVo integrates with my Netflix, Amazon Prime and Youtube accounts and leads me directly to the episodes.  It is very convenient to use and it's quite a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />My only gripe is when I view a recorded program and navigate the menu, I cannot exit the menu to go back to full screen viewing of my recorded program.  The &#34;back&#34; button only backs out to the main menu.  So I have to select the recorded program and resume viewing.  For live TV, I can simply click on the &#34;Live TV&#34; button to go back to full screen viewing.<br /><br />Despite its imperfection, the TiVo with no monthly fee is an outstanding value.  For those who are looking to cut the cable or ditch the dish, this is the way to go.<br /><br />[Update 2017.01.24] Downgrading from 5 to 3 stars.  TiVo is supposed to do periodic updates only overnight, but two Sundays in a row, the unit attempted to perform updates during the day.  The first update froze the unit so we missed 3 quarters of a NFL playoff game.  The second time we caught it in time, so only missed a few minutes of another playoff game.",B01DR4T73Q,B01DR4T73Q,AEIMK4ZR5RZRM2O5XYX4QXIRJJMA,24:56.0,8,TRUE,1991,4.7,3,5

So I put some bicycle chain oil in it to quiet it down.  Then my car's cassette player spitted it out twice.  I thought oh plucking great.  I cleaned the excess oil and tried again.  It has never given me a problem since.  I've used it on several 8-9 hour long road trips and it never skipped a beat.  It's not as convenient as those Bluetooth/FM adapters, but the sound quality is far superior, comparable to CD player.<br /><br />I use it to play music with my iPhone 6 if that matters.

I'm installing this on my 07 camry through the right side. Gonna double check but I'm a few inches short of running it how I want. Looks like I might have to let it dangle in my trunk. #2 is the screws they supply to mount the camera are trash. The damn screw snapped inside as it was just started! Keep in mind I predrill the hole into the PLASTIC part. Maybe I could made the hole slightly bigger but come on. A metal screw breaks inside the plastic! I had to spend time trying to remove the broken piece, ended up scratching the part a bit and go to the store to buy replacement screws.<br /><br />Update: seller contacted me and wanted to make things right. They offered a little compensation for the trouble. Giving 5 stars for the customer service I'm willing to overlook the small stuff or say user error.<br /><br />It's a good product. Might want to run the camera cable along the top of the headliner to save a foot or 2 instead of running it down and along the carpet or buy an extension for larger cars.

5,What a cool way to carry your stuff!,"I have always used 'backpacks'. For daily use, carrying laptops, etc. and travel use for things that I don't want to check at the airlines. Never considered a 'rucksack' before. Not till my daughter pointed this one from KAUKKO out to me.<br /><br />I REALLY like this thing. First, it has a lot of features that the better built backpacks have, adjustable padded shoulder straps, padded and ventilated back, side pockets, etc. And, with this rucksack, all is well made. The stitching is good. The material is top quality. This rucksack has a few things that make it a little different and actually better.<br /><br />First, it's designed to be more protective to the elements than a regular backpack. The way the top flap is shaped, it really does repel the rain. Then the drawstring closure underneath provides extra protection. And, to be honest, I actually like the very well tailored candy striped lining. I know. I'm a guy. Should really care about how colorful it is? Anyway...<br /><br />The leather straps and buckles are VERY well done. The hidden magnetic snaps are very strong. The smaller closure reveals two roomy zippered pockets. The rucksack is a LOT roomier than I thought it would be.<br /><br />I'm not sure what to call the BONUS item that came with it. I'd think that it would best be described as a security type body wallet. It fits well, with the elastic strap. Has two zippered and roomy pockets and a port for your earbud cord, if you carry your cell phone or MP3 player in the belt. Like the rucksack, it is very well made and should service you for a long, long time.<br /><br />I originally got this for my nephew as a gift. No special occasion. I just noticed that his old backpack is worn out. But, I think I'm going to keep it and get him another one, just like it.

5,Excellent mic for Vloggers and bloggers.,"[[VIDEOID:4e13cfd07de4866500f84b1db064ea0f]] I will be the first to admit that I don't know a lot about omnidirectional or other definitions of microphones. But, I do recognize quality. I do quite a bit of recording at my desk, where I discuss the different things that I found helpful, when dealing with quadcopters and drones. I, like many others like to share my experience and ideas. One of the things that's VERY important, when doing informative or instructive videos is to have good quality sound.  I have a great laptop. But, the camera and microphone kind of have their limitations. So, I use a camcorder and a desk mic. This RALENO is an excellent mic. The mic itself is extremely well built. The body is very solid, heavy and durable. The screen guard is SUPER heavy duty woven wire that won't be crunched, compressed or damaged very easily. (I think you'd have to beat it with a hammer to damage it.) The volume control on the top of the mic is very handy, allowing you to tweak the input without going to your computer. The USB connections are NOT typical, and much better than most USB connections for USB microphones. The connection at the mic is a mini-USB, like used for most printers and other durable peripherals. Not a micro, mini or C like many lower quality models. The cable itself is heavy duty with a degaussing magnet inline, to prevent electronic noise in the recording.  The mic stand is light weight, composition material with rubber nonskid feet and a tension clamp for best positioning. The mic is definitely directional, as you can see in my video. This is a good thing. As, the sound field is narrow enough to pick up what's directly in front and nothing else. Most background noise will NOT come through in your recordings. I'm very pleased with this mic and happy to give it five stars.",B088BB2JCD,B088BB2JCD,AHTDYGXHONM2BHENDRMKMC34ZZZA,00:10.7,27,TRUE,1821,4.2,5,4

Next, It's simple enough for kids to set up and use. It doesn't require any special changes in your laptops settings, it will automatically select the HDMI port for display (at least mine did). The LED projection looks just a little pixelated if you're real close to it. But, from a regular viewing distance it looks just fine. The built in speaker has good quality sound. The clip that I included with my review is from one of my own videos. The projection was on an off white wall, about 8 feet away. That should give you some kind of idea of what the projection will look like for you. Also the room was not very dark. So, the picture (as bright as it was) will be brighter in a better (darker) venue.

It has a battery back up, in case of power failures and two USB ports for charging your phones on your nightstand. It's just great, all the way around. Good purchase.

Mostly because I add them to my quadcopters for great aerial pics and videos. I now have two DragonTouch cameras. They keep improving the cameras. So, I keep improving my projects. This one, the Vista5 is by far the best that DragonTouch has produced, and the best in my arsenal of cameras that did NOT cost a fortune like some other big brands might. The Vista5 has 4 field of view settings. I go for the 70*, for the most realistic first person view. This camera also has native 4K at 30fps all the way down to 720p for general recording and lowest data consumption. It also has all of your other popular camera and camcorder settings, making it your most 'go to' camera. BTW, the clip I included is at 1080p at 60fps and I forgot to remove the protective film over the lens. Still, you can see some excellent definition in the clip. I am very pleased with this camera.

4,"Well constructed, fits most phones and tablets.","I purchased this tablet mount, just because it was stated that it will fit all sizes of smart phones and tablets.  I probably had an oddball size tablet, with my nextbook Ares 8A. Just a tad too narrow to fit one way, and too long to fit the other. I tested it with my smartphone, it's fine. But, really didn't want to use my Note9 for this purpose.<br /><br />The two parts of this mount are well constructed. The base is a perfect fit in the phone holder of the Mavic controller. The smart device clamp is well designed and constructed, too. Assembly is simple and the overall attachment and fit to the controller is good, giving you a practical viewing screen of the FPV or map display of the drone's flight, while still giving you full access to the controller.<br /><br />The nomenclature in the listing, and on the box itself, are slightly off, as far as the versatility of the clamp is concerned. However, as I said earlier, this should still work well with most smart phones or tablets.<br /><br />Freewell stands behind their product and their customer service department will do whatever they can to ensure your satisfaction with your purchase.

5,Absolutely perfect solution for an 'eye witness' requirement!,"This car camera is awesome. I am fairly new to this. But, have tried a couple. The versatility of this camera is amazing for the price. Not only does it have motion sensor (it will start recording automatically when there is activity within view of it's 170* FOV lens), motion sensor (it automatically starts recording when it senses movement) and auto-shut off after 2 minutes of inactivity, you can adjust the resolution from 420 all the way to 1080pHD, AND zoom in from standard magnification and 170 FOV all the way to 1.5 power and 90 FOV. You can also change the length of the clips from 1 minute all the way up to 5 minutes. I leave mine at standard and 170 for the greatest range and event capture.  And, in 1 minute clips, so I don't have to edit to have just what I need. Even with it's nice big monitor (which I really like), the camera fits very nicely beside my rearview mirror, without obstructing my view. The power cord is long enough that I can tuck it in along the windshield and bring it back around to the power outlet on the dash. It is possible to have the power cord professionally installed to your auxiliary outlet on the fuse block, to free up your power port and clean up your console.  I recommend this camera to anyone who is on the road a lot or has to deal with heavy traffic and inconsiderate drivers. You never know when you may need an 'eye witness'. This camera will provide you with undisputable testimony! I'm very happy with my purchase.",B07D34FVP6,B07D34FVP6,AHTDYGXHONM2BHENDRMKMC34ZZZA,35:02.5,0,TRUE,1475,4.6,5,5
5,Perfect for trekking your Phantom 4 into those remote locations.,"Perfect compliment to the OEM carrying case of your DJI Phantom 4, 4 Pro or 4 Pro+. The OEM case fits snugly inside the main compartment of this backpack, with simple closures for accessing the case and its contents. The OEM case will hold two batteries, plus the one in the quad. That leaves up to four size adjustable compartments in the top portion of the backpack for additional batteries or other accessories. (The panels dividing the compartments are held in position by Velcro and can be moved or taken out completely.) There are zippered side pockets deep enough to hold extra props and elastic mesh pockets outside of those to hold just about anything the size of a 10 water bottle or smaller. There's another pocket on the front of the main compartment (big enough for one of those collapsible fabric landing pads) that has a sheltered zipper closure to keep out the rain. The back of this backpack is well padded with a breathable mesh cover, making it very comfortable for long hikes to your launch site.The whole backpack shell is made of strong Cordura nylon fabric, water repellent and very durable.

I'm positive that they'll approve once they get past the first-world problem of a new router SSID and password!

The WPS light kept flashing and eventually timed out with no 5Ghz signal. Not a problem, had to login to the interface via the built in webpage and connect to the 5Ghz hotspot manually. But in the end, I ended up disabling 5G on the extender to router side because it was actually slowing the connections down because the 5Ghz band has a harder time going through walls than the 2.4Ghz band.

4,"Attractive laptop, wish it came with windows 7","This laptop was given to me as a present. I use it as a travel laptop. I'll treat the laptop and the OS separately.<br /><br />The Laptop.<br /><br />The positives. The laptop is attractive. The hinges and folding design seems robust, at least in my use. The screen is bright, and seems to have good contrast. Good view angles. Touch control works. The power supply is compact. The laptop does not seem to get too hot. The laptop seems light for its size. SSD is nice.<br /><br />The negatives. No separate mic jack. The screen is glossy, which can be prone to glare. Only two USB ports, though one of them is USB 3.0. Non-removable battery, which means that after regular use of a few years battery replacement will either be a hassle or expensive - I consider this to be the biggest negative here. When folded over and held in ebook mode your fingers will dig in to the keyboard keys. The laptop can only be upgraded to 8gb of ram, I consider this to be low. Function keys F1 through F12 are only available through the FN key. The fan is audible.<br /><br />The OS<br /><br />The positive. The task manager is full of a lot of useful information, a great step up.<br /><br />The negative. I hate windows 8. I had to install a 3rd party start menu program (Start8) just to make it useable. I have wireless issues from time to time, but I'm not sure if this is do to the hardware or the OS. The wireless management software in windows 8 is a step down from windows 7.

2,Overpriced product. Insanely overpriced accessories.,"So, I've had this briefly and it seems to do a pretty good job.  But 30 bucks for a plastic tube and some felt pads?<br />Furthermore, if you want to buy replacement pads you'll be paying at least 10 bucks for ONE pair of replacement pads and a felt washer.  That price, to put it mildly, is INSANE.<br /><br />At this point I don't know how long the felt pads last so I cannot tell you how often they have to be replaced.  Nor do I know how easy or difficult it is to remove the old ones and properly place the new ones. Perhaps one can create their own pads using felt and double sided tape.<br /><br /> A 2 oz bottle of their cleaner is 20 bucks (on sale from $30 right now!).  So, one gallon of this liquid gold would be over $1200 dollars. Really??!!<br /><br />Lastly, the tube fit well on one of my vacuum hoses. It didn't fit on the other.<br /><br />I'm all for capitalism and well aware of the fact that I wasn't forced to buy this product but, come on, charge a more reasonable price for your products.",B014X2SXY0,B014X2SXY0,AETUKO4YCSILQKSNYZPLM5ZHCN5Q,41:33.6,0,TRUE,1013,4.9,2,5

3,finicky and hurty,"I bought mine direct from Samsung and ultimately returned them. I found that I had to fiddle with them constantly to hit the sweet spot for the music to sound like it should instead of like I was listening through a tin can, and while fiddling with them the touch controls become an annoying hassle because you are trying to get the fit right and the music is turning on and off and pausing and skipping, etc, because you are touching them. The buds can't seem to differentiate at all between an actual hold/grip to manipulate them in your ears, and a tap as you would do to actually use a touch control feature.<br /><br />Don't quote me on this because it's not like I counted every review that appeared male vs female, but I found that they hurt and I think it might be because they were designed by somewhat larger-eared males.  I originally assumed the hurty issue was likely because they were designed by some 60 year old man engineer with huge ears (because ears grow our whole lives) and so they were only made to fit kind of older larger ears. I even wrote on my Samsung review that they should have made the fit for the age group of their customer. But now, reading these Amazon reviews, I am noticing that the people saying they fit great seem to mostly be male names and those saying they hurt seem to mostly be female-normative names, so I still think they were designed for larger ears, but maybe for males they will fit better - I truly don't know how different in size male vs female ears are though; it's just a random observation of these reviews of hurt vs feel great.<br /><br />Bottom line, they hurt my ears and were too picky about being perfectly aligned in my ear. On the rare occasion I hit that sweet spot they sounded great and never felt like they were going to fall out. Too bad it took so much effort to find that spot.",B089B7LX7N,B0BTCLFDHM,AGQDLBPCYRCSEHP2E5TNVHWUOXRA,22:34.3,0,FALSE,1850,3.6,3,4

5,"Nice riser, does what I wanted it to do!","I was looking for a wooden riser that was 8 inches deep or shallower to free up some writing space on my desk. This fit the bill. Assembly was a bit challenging for me (small hands trying to hold the pieces in line while working a screwdriver is not my strong suit). But it's beautiful and functional. The moving pieces are held on with short dowels and come off really easy when moving it but it's a very sturdy unit over all.<br /><br />For me, my monitor overlapped with my laptop. So I had to extend the left side and move monitor piece over. It's not symmetrical which messes with my brain a bit. One reason was I also have a plug-in panel on the top of my desk for USB and 2 outlets. This interfered with the riser causing me to have to extend it on that side.<br /><br />Overall, a great little unit. Solid build. Looks nice. Functions well.

4,best earbuds for under $50 that I have tried,"Budget-priced earbuds are complicated to review because, in my experience, all $200 earbuds sound significantly better than all $50 earbuds, but there is still a lot of demand for value-priced ""good enough"" products. I do own a couple of $200 earbuds and they do sound noticeably richer and clearer than these $40 earbuds. However, when I'm out jogging or traveling (eg airplane or train) or listening to voice podcasts, having the absolute best sound quality isn't really important to me. In those situations, features are more important to me, like active noise cancellation, equalization, good volume, good battery life, and easy access to the features. I'd rather use cheap earbuds that I don't mind losing somewhere along the way.<br /><br />These earbuds have average quality sound for the $40 price. Where these Donner earbuds beat the competition is the features. I've never owned $40 earbuds with app control before. The user manual has a QR code to let you download the app. The QR code did not work, but I did find the ""Donner Control"" app in the Google Play app store and the app works fine on my Android phone. The app lets me pick from pre-programmed equalization settings or design my own. Adjusting the equalization for different types of music makes a significant difference in audio clarity. The app also lets me choose from 3 active noise cancellation modes. These features don't work as well as in $200 earbuds, but these are $40 earbuds and most $40 earbuds don't have any of these features or any app at all. You can control some of these features with the confusing set of triple-tap commands on the earbuds, but I can never remember those and would rather just tap the picture in the app.<br /><br />The app also lets you download firmware updates from Donner. None was available when I checked, but this could be a great way for them to refine the features of the earbuds or even add new features. They ask you to give them your email address and create an account when you open the app, but I did not and the core features of the app still work OK.<br /><br />Battery life for these earbuds is good for this price range (6 to 8 hours, depending on whether or not you use ANC). As with most budget-priced wireless earbuds, maximum volume is OK but not great. Bass is above average for the $40 price. Static noise is very low. The Bluetooth connection has been very stable for me, even when I'm 30 feet away from my phone or in a different room in the house.<br /><br />I can't give these earbuds 5 stars because I can easily buy better sound quality with more money, but these are solid 4 stars for value at the current $40 price.",B0B3WZRZ6Y,B0B7QZRBC1,AHDZKPPKUT7HD47LXCBN7RQNN6KQ,20:44.9,6,FALSE,2655,4,4,4
3,budget-quality binoculars for a budget price,"We have a couple of other pairs of binoculars; one cost $300 and the other cost $100. This set is far cheaper that our others and you get what you pay for. On the plus side, I have a larger face and I have no problem focusing these binoculars despite what some other reviewers say. However, despite the binoculars having adjustable eye cups, they are not adjustable enough for me to focus while wearing eye glasses. I have to take my glasses off then adjust the eye cups all the way out to get a clear image.<br /><br />In bright sunlight, these binoculars give me a reasonably colorful and clear but not especially sharp image. There is some distortion and chromatic aberration, even in the center of the image. In lower light conditions, like around sunset when the wild animals I want to watch are more active, these binoculars give me dim image with poor detail. All compact binoculars degrade quickly in lower light conditions, but cheaper ones like this especially so.<br /><br />The field of view is advertised as 342 feet at 1000 yards. That number is printed on the front of the binoculars. However, in use the field of view is much smaller than our Nikon 10x25 binoculars that also advertise as 342 feet field of view. These Pronite binoculars are semi-sharp and clear over a much smaller portion of the field of view than our Nikon as well.<br /><br />In summary, you get what you pay for. These binoculars are near the cheaper end of binoculars that I would consider usable. They are somewhat usable, especially if you don't need great clarity. These binoculars can help you figure out which way a road or trail heads through the valley ahead. They may not be able to distinguish one species of bird from another if you are looking at the shape and colors of the bird.",B08NTD88HW,B08NTD88HW,AHDZKPPKUT7HD47LXCBN7RQNN6KQ,54:28.4,0,FALSE,1780,4,3,4

It does bend with just hand pressure.<br /><br />The interior size of the case is shown in the product description. The case is an inch deeper than my 13 inch Chromebook, but I knew that from the product description before I received it. It may be a snugger fit for Macbooks.<br /><br />I like that they use sturdy genuine YKK zippers since zippers are always the first part to break on cases like this.<br /><br />There are no handles of any kind on this case.

Volume is adequate, but not as loud as some other true wireless earbuds.<br /><br />I downloaded the Yamaha Headphones Controller app from the Google Play app store.

There are no settings for different listener preferences or music styles. There is no noise cancellation or equalizer profiles, which my $100 earbuds have. There is no ambience passthrough mode, which even my $80 earbuds have.<br /><br />6 hour battery life is great, but my $100 earbuds have similar battery life with more volume.<br /><br />These earbuds have a simple plastic look and feel.

Some products with similar functionality and similar prices have aluminum bodies that feel much more durable. Also, this light is fixed at the 5600K daylight color while other video lights support a range of light temperatures, which can be useful indoors or at night.

Compact size is great for travel, since older hotels don't have enough power outlets for modern travelers and the outlets are often hidden behind desks or under beds.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the USB power ports are pretty weak. You get 2.4A divided among 3 ports, so if you're trying to charge 3 devices, each one gets less than 1A. Modern smartphones and tablets will often fast-charge at 3A, so charging with these ports will be very slow. USB powered laptops can use even more power and will complain about being charged at less than 3A.<br /><br />I don't like that there is no USB-C charging port and no USB Power Delivery fast charging, which are becoming the standard for smartphones and laptops.<br /><br />This device is not UL listed for electrical safety. As phone and tablet and laptop batteries get more and more powerful, electrical safety becomes more and more important.

5,Saved my Tower!,"My three year old i7 tower with its still impressive Geforce decided to freak out and shut down due to the Northbridge turning into an oven. I couldn't get my Asus to stay on more than 3 minutes before it would abruptly shut down. When turning it back on, I would get a NB temperature warning, so I knew it was hopeless. I opened it up and saw the results of the bake off: My passive heatsink was resting on the floor of my tower, instead of its designated spot on the MB. Come to think of it, I did hear this clang sound at one point. I ordered this product in hopes that it would solve the problem and eliminate the need to purchase a new motherboard (I'm not THAT technically good). Turns out - it was fairly easy to put in. I just used some 90% isopropyl alcohol to clean the left over goo from the previous thermal paste, applied the included thermal paste, placed the adjustable metal rods with spring anchors into the heatsink's base, and snapped this baby down. Finally, I plugged the fan into a nearby free power cord, waited about 20 minutes, then turned it on. Drum roll .... perfect! The temperature levels are now safe and I got my main computer back (so long for now backup laptop). Oh, and the fan is super quiet.<br /><br />Just one note: My heat sink popped off on its own from the drastic heat, so popping in this replacement NB cooling fan was a breeze. If you are removing a faulty heatsink/fan that still happens to be in place,  you may need to take the entire mother board out,.You see, those two screw like things (I called them anchors), snap down into holes through the motherboard in order  to clamp down the fan. Once they snap down, the bottoms expand so there's no way get them back out except by squeezing the bottom end (under the motherboard) to get them through.",B005UFJC8G,B005UFJC8G,AEHVMGM7F5XV7ZIVECBB345NOO4A,13:55.0,1,TRUE,1796,2.3,5,2

I have also used it as an overnight bag and found it was perfect for the excursion.<br />I have noticed that the hardware does squeak now and again but it's not annoying or loud. The strap and hardware are not showing any signs of wear and tear and I trust them.<br />To the bag's designers and fabricators: Well done!  ... but if I may suggest two things.  For future designs it might be worth it to consider, especially on the larger bags, a pocket on either end for a small water bottle. This way the bottles wouldn't sweat on items inside the bag. Also, I suggest  sewing a simple X pattern on the inside divider to prevent the cushion from folding and rolling up inside the cloth casing.<br /><br />All in all, I give the bag a 4.8 out of 5 stars.

4,"In spite of some drawbacks, these are quite good.","I was a little skeptical when I received these.

There are also over-the-ear hooks to ensure they'll stay on, and even these aren't uncomfortable.<br /><br />The sound is really quite good.  I was astounded by it.  On the downside, the set-up was a little iffy.  I never got the audio instructions and had to suss things out for myself.  But that wasn't difficult.

5,Loved to Death,"I bought a pair of Crossfade LP2s back in 2014 (6 years ago), and since they've had heavy regular use. My favorite headphones were/are AKG reference monitors, which I also still have and use, but those have a special place that they don't leave. So in terms of listening hours and mileage, the LP2s are by far my most-used set of headphones.<br /><br />In short, they sound great, feel comfortable with extended wear, and can take quite a beating. They also didn't cost so much that I felt I had to be over-protective of them, which is part of why they got used so much. I'm going to get another pair of V-Modas soon as I decide which ones I want next.<br /><br />I was hard on this pair, and now they're pretty battle-scarred. I managed to crack the 3.5mm headphone jack a year or two after I first got them. The damage was only cosmetic, but it bugged me so I popped the earpiece open and soldered in a new metal jack. The top headband started wearing out and falling apart when the headphones were about 5 years old, so I peeled the outer cover off. Even then, they were still comfortable and sounded great. Now the earpads are falling apart, and even though I could replace them, I think it may be time for a new pair given how banged-up these are.<br /><br />I have a very large head and somewhat large ears, and but I didn't feel compelled to get the ""XL"" pads. The stock ones fit me just fine. The LP2s also feel very solidly built without being too heavy. I prefer headphones with a flatter response curve (i.e. no built-in ""bass boost"" or anything like that), and the LP2s sound very good as-is and even better with an equalizer adjusted to my taste. While I do think my fancier AKGs have a better soundstage and give me a strong sense that the instruments in a song are in the room with me, the V-Modas aren't far behind. Plus there's no way the AKGs would survive what the V-Modas have. I think I dimly recall the LP2s needing a bit of a break-in period before they started sounding their best, but that was so many listening hours ago that I am not 100% sure.<br /><br />UPDATE: I just got a pair of V-moda M100s as a replacement, and it seems like they need breaking in. The mids and highs sound a little compressed, and only the bass is clearly distinguishing itself from the rest of the mix. It's not that bad, but also not as good as the old pair. I'll update if they open up and start sounding as good as my old LP2s after some listening time.<br /><br />So in short, I really got my money's worth out of my V-Modas and I am ready for my next pair. Even my banged-up old ones still sound good enough that they might become a backup/travel pair if I decide to give them new pads.",B00HYH7HXA,B00WSM2TRK,AFHCHM6DT2T7KWC5WVTGJYAWARXA,08:09.3,1,FALSE,2695,5.1,5,5

1,"Does NOT work with devices it claims to, blocks neighboring ports","I guess it’s good that somebody makes this adapter, but it doesn’t work as described and its housing is so much fatter than a standard HDMI, it renders neighboring ports useless. I thoroughly checked the product info before ordering and it didn’t work. I called tech support, who insisted it would work, and sent me another. Now I see in the comments, this item often does not work with Apple LED Cinema Displays. I believe one reviewer may be correct, that this is not mini display port, but thunderbolt (and while there are times the two work together, such as plugging a MDP monitor into a TB port on a Mac, adapters are a situation in which it matters which is which).<br /><br />Even if it did work, it’s so much fatter than a typical HDMI cable, it blocks the ports next to it. In this case, it blocks my thunderbolt connection, turning my solution for using 2 MDP displays back into, only being able to use one.<br /><br />I’m not sure if it’s relevant that the input on the adapter is strangely shallow, so the MDP doesn’t even slide in all the way.<br /><br />In short I imagine this is fine for a narrow margin of the people seeking this adapter. But it does not work on all the devices it claims to, it might not be MDP after all, and it causes as many problems as it solves in a crowded input situation.",B07H29J86N,B07H29J86N,AFR2LYPKKDDYJU2NIHH5EDANHDHQ,38:11.1,2,TRUE,1315,4.9,1,5

3,Great... for a whle,"I really liked this bag for the first nine months or so, but after a while, its flaws started to get to me. First off, the pen holder sucks because the top flap is has a soft net backing that grabs the pens and pulls them out. The little pouch that holds the bottoms of pens is so shallow that they constantly pop out - it basically serves little purpose. Second,  the netting on big pouch on the back side of the main flap is not very strong. It ripped while lifting a pen out. Third, the velcro on the back pouch wears out quickly. At this point, it is worthless and the back really doesn't close at all.  Finally, the bag has little structure, so it kind of sags and hangs badly over my shoulder. When I carry it by the handle, it is even worse.<br />The canvas and strap are actually pretty nice.

5,Unbelievable! Chi-Fi delivering overtime with these,"Best sounding in-ear headphones I've ever heard, by a mile. I've owned the Bang and Olufsen H3, Sony XBA H1, Klipsch S4, X7, X6i, 1More Dual Drivers, Beats by Dr Dre Tour (wired), and Monster Cable's Jamz and Turbines.<br /><br />The bass has lots of range and goes DEEP, in some tracks it even reminds me of my Kicker CVR 12' car subwoofer I used to blast about 15 years ago. It is not quite that overpowering, of course, and it balances out nicely with the other frequencies. The midrange is very present and natural sounding judging by how vocals and guitar strings sound. The highs are beautiful, they sound very accurate to me and present no sibilance. The overall sound is very rich and detailed, it allows you to follow specific instruments as you listen, and it even presents some soundstage (which I didn't think was possible in in-ears, maybe my aforementioned B&O H3 had some)<br /><br />Overall these do have a V sound signature with boosted bass and treble, but not as marked as almost everything else that's in the market. In order to eliminate any fatigue caused by this, I would strongly recommend that you disable any bass boost, make sure you're not elevating bass or treble at all in EQ, and go even deeper and disable default features like Dolby Atmos (Oneplus phone) and even the Hi Fi quad DAC on LG phones (which I've found does introduce a bit of a V curve itself)<br /><br />Other than their sound these earphones' build quality seems very good and durable.

5,"Do your homework, don't forget the thermal paste, and go slow","So far, so good. If you have never installed components like this before, it is not impossible, but replacing a CPU is not as straightforward as popping in a new video card or RAM. Do your homework, research thoroughly, and watch some videos. If you're buying a CPU upgrade, I'm sure you're already familiar with the research and review process, but definitely do your homework on the system you intend to use it with. Also, don't forget to buy some good thermal paste (such as [[ASIN:B002CQU14A Noctua NT-H1 Thermal Compound - Retail]], or something similar) if you don't already have some.<br /><br />I happen to be using this on a Mac Pro 5,1 (mid-2010) tower, replacing my stock 2.8 GHz processor.

5,OMG it works!! It really works!,"I wish I would have tried these a long time ago. Could have saved me a lot of aggravation over the years. I'm sure a lot of people have heard of these and are likely sceptical. At least that's my excuse. That and I live in an old house with old wiring and many circuits. It's a San Francisco Victorian with bent hallways and a nightmare for both cell reception and WiFi range.<br /><br />I have wanted to get networking from the back of the flat to the front. That seemingly simple concept never works. What I did get to work was to put WiFi in the back, and then a WiFi extender in the front with a 20' antenna extension which then pushed the antenna to the middle. Even that was tricky.<br /><br />I even once tried a Verizon 4G LTE router to get some broadband in the front. It was expensive and still didn't work. So I pretty much resigned myself to just running cat5e or cat6 cable down the hallway, which is what I wanted to avoid. But right before I did that I decided to give this a shot.<br /><br />The install took all of 5 seconds, seriously. Plug a box into one outlet in the back of the flat. Plug that box into my switch. Now run to the front of the flat. Plug that box into an outlet. Run the Ethernet from that box to my switch. Plug Linux box into switch. Boot up and test the speed. 53 MB/sec down, 4 up. Pretty much my ISP limit. My only concern is security, but they do have software, but it requires Windows I bet. I use Linux. I'll see what I can do to lock this down. But it does work. Fantastically so. Not sure the front and back are on the same circuit. Guessing they are. Either way, I finally got the front connected to the back without WiFi or a long Ethernet running down my hallway. And that is 5 stars!",B0081FLFQE,B0081FLFQE,AGO6RBHKEFEJAAA4TUXYE7J47IKA,53:33.0,1,TRUE,1734,3.2,5,3
4,"Very good, missing Amazon Music, feels fast, navigates well","I just unpackaged and started using the Amazon Fire TV. Right off I had to do a small update which didn't take long at all. Next there is a neat video that shows you how to use the device. I think this is the first time I have had a video box teach me how to use it with a video. It is a nice touch.<br /><br />I'm already a prime member, but for those who are not the video spoke of a 30 days trial.<br /><br />Right off the bat I noticed in the main menu of items to choose from that there are movies, tv, watchlist, video library, games, apps, photo and settings. What's missing from this is the Amazon Music of which I have quite a few albums. I hope we get to see music in some future update. That's kind of a glaring omission in my opion. One star knocked off for that right there.<br /><br />One cool feature I noted right off the bat is that the device already knows me. I didn't have to log in or do anything.<br /><br />The watchlist<br /><br />So I went straight to my watchlist to confirm that it indeed already knows me. It does. And I went to a recent season of shows I am watching where the first two episodes have been watched and the third has not. There is a white bar at the bottom of those watched and missing from the one that is yet to be watched. So I'll guess that is my progress bar as well. Nice touch.<br /><br />Voice feature<br /><br />This feature is slightly confusing to me right off. What you do is hold the mic button down until you hear a tone, then continue to hold it down as you speak your question or title search. When you are done talking, only then do you release the button. I kept letting it go as soon as I heard the tone, which causes it to attempt to process the question. So the feature is a little odd, but once you get used to that oddity it works quite well.<br /><br />I asked it, &#34;what's new this week&#34; and got three suggestions. I further asked it questions like, show me my watchlist which offered me two methods, &#34;watch list&#34; and &#34;watchlist&#34;. Neither of which showed me my actual watchlist. Clearly the audio search isn't yet fully aware of navigation.<br /><br />Purchasing a TV show<br /><br />Photos<br /><br />Looks like they have an iOS and Android app that lets you share photos with Amazon Cloud Drive and thus have them available on this device. I'll have to try that out. I'll skip it for now.<br /><br />Apps<br /><br />This looks good for now. NetFlix and Pandora are here as well as Hulu. I use all three of those so that's good.<br /><br />Games<br /><br />There are good looking games here. I didn't buy the game controller as I own a console already, but I might rethink that.<br /><br />YouTube<br /><br />I didn't see YouTube, so I did a voice search and an app popped up. Once the app downloaded and installed, I had to visit an activation page of YouTube to connect it to the device. Very simple and now I have YouTube on here.<br /><br />NetFlix<br /><br />Netflix didn't have a simple activate system. I had to punch in my email and password via the remote. Boo! In this era of complex passwords, activation should become a standard function on TV based media devices.<br /><br />Navigation<br /><br />The navigation is quite smooth. I guess thanks to some good specs under the hood. This device doesn't feel sluggish at all. Getting to your watch this is as fast as hitting 'home' and then moving up or down from wherever you left off. I can do it in a second. There is also a nice back button so you can navigate backwards. All device should do this. Works perfectly.<br /><br />Fast Forward<br /><br />When you are watching a movie, you can fast forward and see a small picture window that gives you a visual preview of the fast forward event.

I am investing in a T2i manual to become better aquainted with the many features the camera offers, but even with my lack of prior use of a Digital SLR I have found the camera quite easy to use.

4,"Paper Thin Leaf INdoor HDTV Antenna - works, with some pixelation","[[ASIN:B004QK7HI8 Paper Thin Leaf Indoor HDTV Antenna - Made in the USA!]]<br />The product works fairly well, but programs pixelate and freeze briefly quite frequently, as I have observed occurs also with satellite TV. If this does not bother you, it can be a reasonable solution for low-cost basic channels (mainstream networks like ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, plus local access stations). Since I get most of my programming via the Internet, I could live without cable and could tolerate the glitchiness of over-the-air digital TV signals for watching the news and other non-cinematic programming. But pixelation bothers my wife, so it's a non-starter for us.<br /><br />I don't know if any antenna, regardless of price or form factor, would eliminate the periodic pixelation of digital signals. This seems to be a problem inherent in over-the-air digital transmissions, but I am not a telecommunications engineer and may be wrong. There may be some antenna technology that defeats this problem. If so, you would have to compare its purchase, installation, and calibration costs to the payback period (months of no cable bill) to determine whether it would be a good deal for you.

2,Good video; the rest leave a lot to be desired,"I have been using this KVM for 10 months.<br /><br />I got it to share a monitor/keyboard/mouse between two laptops, a Lenovo on a docking station and an HP.  Both laptops running Windows 10 (latest releases installed).  All connections from each laptop to the KVM are on individual ports (no port sharing)<br /><br />The issues I am describing below I had not experienced when the same keyboard/mouse (all combinations) were connected directly to the laptops.<br /><br />Pros<br />Form factor: really nice and small.  Can easily put it somewhere out of the way.<br /><br />Remote: great for switching machines and avoiding using the key sequence.<br /><br />Video: good 4K at 60Hz.  I am not playing video games, but for everything I have used it, including watching movies, the video quality is good.<br /><br />Cons<br />Keyboard: since the beginning I noticed a sluggish response and at random intervals it repeats (infinite times) the last key pressed!  When using the key sequence to switch machines, may times the KVM would stay in an ""ESC"" mode, thus I had to hit the ESC key to get it back to normal operation.  That is why I exclusively use the remote for switching machines.  The other annoying behaviour is that when typing some keys will not be captured, so when writing a document or entering a password, there can be errors (missing letters).  I tried multiple keyboards (a Logitech and two different Dell-branded models) with exactly the same behaviour, so it could not be the keyboard.<br /><br />Mouse: sluggish, especially when switching between applications or placing in web form fields.  The behaviour is the same with different brands (Logitech, Microsoft, Dell-branded).<br /><br />Support: contacted support to see about a resolution.  They took over a week to respond to my email.

I have worked with this scope since I received it.  I cannot see anything through it.  I cannot get it to work.  I ask a question and received answers from several owners, they replied that they were having the same problem.  I will not take away any rating stars, since I still believe that this is a very well made telescope for the money.  I do believe that I received a not so good of a scope.

I like to read holding the Kindle one handed, but even holding it with both hands, or even holding it in one hand and using the index finger of the other hand (the most careful way to tap the touch screen) when I tap the right side to advance a page, it often jumps forward several pages. And it is incredibly annoying to have to page back to the page I was trying to get to in the first place. Jerks me right out of the book. It's annoying enough that I wish I'd kept my old, non touch screen Kindle. It seems to be confined to page turning, so when I need to use the on screen keyboard it works great.

I read someone said you could buy a solar panel for $25, the problem is if you open the charging port plug (which is painful to plug back in after each charge) this camera is no longer weather proof.  I think it would be GREAT (and I would totally buy it) if Wyze could make a solar panel which has sealed weather proof plugs on both end so I can mount this camera out door and never have to worry about battery running out.<br /><br />Come to think of it, maybe I will buy a solar panel and try to seal the charging port myself.

Brightness, contrast, and color are great.<br /><br />It comes with a desktop stand that tilt adjusts. It has Vesa mounting holes. The monitor is about 2 and a half inches thick, if you need that measurement to plan mounting. It also comes with a power cord and VGA cable. The monitor has an HDMI port, but no HDMI cable is included.<br /><br />I tested the monitor with both VGA and HDMI cables. The VGA cable, which carries an analog signal to the display, produced a very slight blurring in text---hardly noticeable, but it had the effect of smoothing the text somewhat. The HDMI cable, which carries a digital signal, produced pixel-sharp text. Which you prefer is a matter of personal taste. Some people might prefer super sharp text; some might like text that looks a bit smoother.<br /><br />The only negatives are that the driver download link isn't yet working---but that was no problem since my Linux installation found and installed drivers that work well---and the RGB sliders to tweak the color settings were grayed out and it took a while to get them to work, and I'm not sure what setting I changed that made them active (I think it was turning off the dynamic contrast feature).

The ASUS Chromebooks are physically a little flimsier, but I would recommend an accident protection plan for any Chromebook. My old ASUS (before I broke the screen hinge) was perfect for me. Consistently fast and a crazy long battery life.

The cut out at the bottom is exactly the right size to allow easy access to the power button and charging port without compromising on protection. The auto sleep and wake has worked perfectly every time so far.

2,"Meh.  It's just ""OKAY"". Performance sucks.","I wanted to use this in photoshop and illustrator for graphic design work.  It's not great for that, if I'm honest.<br /><br />So here are the issues:<br /><br />1) It lags. BIG TIME.<br />2) It also uses a LOT of RAM, causing background apps and services to crash, at times.<br />3) Sometimes it will register a stroke in a weird way, and will cause a blob or a darted gesture to register instead.<br />4) You apparently can't manually set the orientation, so even if you are designing something in long-orientation, you have to use the pad in wide orientation, and it really reduces your usable area.  I haven't found a way to pre-set the orientation one way or the other.  The default is wide orientation.<br />5) it's not as stroke-intensity sensitive as I would like it to be.  It either registers a stroke as firm or almost non-existent.  There doesn't seem to be a middle ground.<br />6) The quick &#34;buttons&#34; around the frame are TOTALLY USELESS.  They don't work in a single program I've tried so far.<br /><br />Plus side is, it's Windows 10 compatible, and does work in both Photoshop CC and Illustrator CC.  But that's about it.

2,"Had high hopes for these, but the sound cracks and splits, and they are not wear-friendly","I was really looking forward to using these for working out and running, but they just don't fit the bill--at all.<br /><br />Firstly, the ear loops are awkward and tend to shift and drop a lot while wearing, so the ear buds often come unseated from your outer ear canal.  The over-ear clips are heavy and awkward, so they significantly bend and pull your ears down and you end up looking like Dumbo (at least I do lol).<br /><br />The bigger issue, for me, is that there is a real problem in audio quality.  No matter what I listen to, there is cracking and splitting in the audio.  At first, I thought the splitting might be from a bad bluetooth connection, so I tried pairing these with several devices, but it remained.  And the cracking occurs in tandem with percussion, which leads me to believe the issues have more to do with the audio quality than a connection issue.",B00428N9OK,B00428N9OK,AGTVTC3QVSRN7VPXGQKHOKVHNEVQ,14:52.9,1,TRUE,876,4.5,2,5

This is perfect for writing and drawing.  There is virtually no wobble when placed at the right angle and when the stand is positioned correctly.  It's a good idea to experiment with what works best in your desired angles before actually installing the stand.<br /><br />Just a word of caution, the other listing for this product has several reviews that talk about how hard it is to remove the adhesive from the product.

4,"No tactile bumps on F and J, amazing for backlighting","I have the “White” color option in this set of keycaps from Akko. White is a bit misleading, the color is actually glossy and nearly translucent. This is actually what I wanted, I was looking all over for nearly clear keycaps, but I did want to point that out.<br /><br />If you like maximum backlighting, this might be the set for you. I was using white pudding caps before, and I thought they let a lot of light shine through. The difference is night and day. These Akko caps show backlighting on all sides and the top of the cap. I’ve included a picture of a white pudding cap surrounded by the clear Akkos to show the difference.<br /><br />I’m using the keycaps with Akko Vintage White (MX) switches. The keycaps fit well, but they took a bit of force to fit on the switches.<br /><br />I am disappointed the F and J keys do not have ridges or bumps. I’m a touch typist and using an ergo board with 56 keys, I rely on those ridges to help me orient my hands. This set has so much variety that I wish Akko had included doubles of F and J or even blanks with the ridges.<br /><br />Speaking of keycap variety: the set has some great 1u options! My current keyboard is an Iris Rev 6, all keys are 1u size. But most keycap sets don’t have 1u keycaps for Shift, Control, Command/Windows, and so on. This set does, which is a big help. I also like the cute animal keycaps, they add some fun to my board.<br /><br />I believe the ASA height is original to Akko. They have a helpful height chart on their site, comparing ASA to OEM, JDA, OSA, and Cherry. I was using OEM before, and switching to ASA and the glossy feel of the keycaps took about two days of adjustment.",B09WQYWSM7,B09WR1YPBB,AFVV7CLXY43P3Z3F7SROBZATZVSQ,59:21.9,4,FALSE,1666,4.3,4,4

4,"Love the 8gb, wish it felt less plastic","First off this works perfectly for what I wanted it for... sitting on the couch, relaxing, while the TV is on. I do not use this for work or gaming, I have a desktop for that. I was using a tablet, but honestly I hate it. I just can't adjust to typing on a touch screen, I want a real keyboard. I also hate fingerprints on my screen. I deal with it on my phone, but for a larger screen it makes me crazy. So I figured this would be a good solution, when it popped up for review. It fits comfortably on my lap and the screen is small enough I can see over it to watch tv, but large enough it is easy on my eyes. So far its been great, although I miss the left and right mouse buttons built into the touch pad area of most laptops. Maybe its a Chromebook thing, but I will just have to adjust.<br /><br />I will say though it does feel a bit flimsy. I like the lightness, but in my lap typing I can feel the plastic body flexing. For the price I'd expect something a bit more durable, at least for the bottom half with the keyboard. The keys are responsive, although I'm use to my mechanical keyboard so switching to the thin chiclet style makes them feel mushier than they probably are. For a small laptop, they don't feel cramped and they are raised enough that I'm not miss-typing.<br /><br />It was incredibly easy to set up, just entered my google log-in info and poof I was up and running. This would be a 5 star product if they hadn't just made it a bit sturdier.",B07VT254P6,B0B3CL33Y1,AEXYLV5YOYWSLGG47VVECVURA7XQ,53:09.4,1,FALSE,1468,4.4,4,4
3,"Not worth the price, bass and general sound quality is lacking","When reviewing headsets, I don't just pop them on and hit play on a favorite song or take a call. I actually run them through a battery of sound tests from an audio site. I run all sets through the same test to make it fair. First on my PC and then on my iPhone XS. I find it's the best way to make an unbiased review.<br />• Bass: Poor with a limited range. It also wasn’t balanced between the earbuds.<br />• High freq: Better than the bass, but still a limited range. It was balanced between the earbuds much better though.<br />• Rattle: None, but it would be weird if earbuds rattled. Ok that’s not true, I stepped on a pair at the gym that rattled afterwards. Oops.<br />• Volume: Sufficient. I don’t blast my earbuds, because I like to keep my hearing. I could turn it low enough to not hear, and loud enough to be uncomfortable.<br />• Clarity: Isolated for the sound test they did fine. However, outside the site the clarity started to degrade, and on a call was bad enough to be an issue.<br /><br />The sound check results were mediocre. Bass was lacking, as was the general range of the set. These actually did worse than their cheaper behind the neck set (Jabra Evolve 65e UC).<br /><br />As for things other than sound, like usability I like to ask myself what I’m looking for and if product meets those expectations. So, here goes:<br /><br />Would these last the entire workday?<br />Yes and No, if you take them off to charge during lunch then you will probably be fine. Otherwise no they are going to die out about 75% through a standard 8 hr workday. They require a USB port and their little case thing to charge. I had no issues as long as I remember to charge them at lunch.<br /><br />Are they easy to use?<br />The basics, yes. All the extra features, not so much. I opened the box up and was happy to see the quick-start guide, unfortunately if there is a manual I didn't get one. I found a digital copy tucked away in the iPhone app, but nothing in the box itself. That made anything past the basics in the quick-start guide a matter of trial and error, until I found the manual tucked away in the App. For the price, that seems like a rather cheap move. There is a ton of useful info in the manual that is not contained in the quick-start guide.<br /><br />Can I take calls seamlessly?<br />Yes, but for me at least the call experience was lacking. The voices on some but not all calls were a bit muddled, however they could hear me just fine. So poor marks for the sound quality, but high marks for the mic.<br />Speaking of mics, can I mute the mic easily?<br />Easily, yes. But knowing for sure if you are muted (we've all been there) only when using the computer dongle, on my iPhone using Bluetooth, eek not so much. Had to leave it to faith. That was a bit scary.<br /><br />Plays music well (aka does it have range and bass)?<br />Meh. I have the sound review at the top. As you can imagine, lack of bass negatively impacts listening to music. I mean it wasn’t awful but it wasn’t great either.<br /><br />Can I opt to hear people talking to me (audio pass-through)?<br />Yes, but it sounds super static and buzzy. The sound is not clear and crisp at all. Also, you can't just pop an earbud out and listen with one ear. If the earbuds are anymore than head-width apart they stop working all together. According to the manual, you should be able to use the right earbud by itself, but that was not my experience. It also would stop working (although it worked a bit longer than the left) once they were too far apart.<br /><br />Noise-canceling abilities, can I at least block out the cubical next to me?<br />Sort of. You can block drumming blah blah blah sounds, but ringing phones and coworkers talking, not so much. Although it did take the edge off. The Jabra iPhone app for these has some cool ambient sound machine settings, waves crashing, thunderstorm, white noise, etc. Probably my favorite thing about this whole set.<br /><br />Are they comfortable?<br />I didn't like them, but I am a petite human and have small ears. I also don't like the weird vacuuming pressure you feel when wearing anything noise-cancelling. I will give these neutral marks for comfort, I think if you had larger ear canals and didn't mind closed type headsets these would probably be fine.<br /><br />Are these worth the price?<br />Nope. For the price these should be spectacular and check all the boxes. They are mediocre in sound quality even though they are packed with features. If you plan on just tossing them on and not actually testing the audio, go for it. They work. But for the price, they should handle music and calls equally well. They do not.<br /><br />Overall, I will have to say I was rather disappointed with these. I also reviewed their behind the neck version (Jabra Evolve 65e UC) and was hoping I had just gotten a dud with that set. Well lightening either struck twice, or the audio on these is even worse than the cheaper behind the neck version. Darn, because I wanted to love these. I have a soft spot for gadgets with cool features. These had potential. I will give them three stars because if the price point wasn’t so high, they would be okay. Not great, but they’d get the job done. I also really liked the ambient sounds you could listen to on the app. A nice little extra that was unexpected.<br /><br />Hope that helps!",B07S1X999B,B07S1X999B,AEXYLV5YOYWSLGG47VVECVURA7XQ,21:59.7,2,FALSE,5373,4.5,3,5

5,Phenominal,"This is a beautiful device.<br /><br />I’m not in love with the case. It connects via magnets and that isn’t very secure. I plan to upgrade that in the near future.<br /><br />The pen is excellent. You do get the writing on paper not a screen feel from it, which is perfect. The button as highlighter is a nice feature, especially given highlighting is a common thing for books. The eraser feels a little harsh, no rubber and you do need to press down enough to depress it, but it’s not a stopping point. It’s an excellent pen. The Staedtler digital pen works, including the eraser, so if you lose the one that comes with it, there are options.<br /><br />I am disappointed that waterproofing and cellular, both included in the Oasis, are missing in this.<br /><br />I see a lot of comparison with the competition, with some disagreement as to who the competition is. Contenders are dedicated e-Ink writing tablets such as the Remarkable 2 or SuperNote and the Kobo Elipsa. I’ve used all of those, so let me try to break down how I see this stacking up.<br /><br />For the Remarkable 2/SuperNote family, it depends entirely on what your goals are. Those are dedicated note taking devices that threw in some ebook capabilities. The Scribe is a reading device that enhancing the note taking and threw in some notebooks. The difference in the focus drives the difference in user experience. The e-note devices have multiple virtual pen options, from pencil to fountain pen, to brush pen controlled by the pressure of the stylus on the screen, where this has a very limited selection. You can add templates (with Remarkable 2 that’s a bit of a pain and you need to redo it with every software update, but you can do it; with Supernote it’s simple). E-note devices offer OCR and the ability to synchronize with multiple services, such as Evernote, OneNote and DropBox (Remarkable with a subscription). Kindle Scribe has no OCR I could find and sends notes only via email to the account of record. I see no way yet to add templates, but I bet, as with Remarkable 2, someone will design a workaround.<br /><br />Where e-note devices are better at creating and sending documents, Kindle Scribe is better at receiving and reading them, especially with the updated send to Kindle website. Remarkable, best of breed for that, can send with a Chrome extension that sometimes flakes out and an app that requires almost constant logging back in. Kindle can go through a Chrome extension, a web page, an app, email, or, for Kindle books and library books, right from the Kindle store.<br /><br />In addition, the Kindle Scibe has a superior reading experience. The screen has a higher resolution, which makes for a more comfortable reading experience. Where, with the exception of the Boox Lumi Max which is in a totally different price category, those devices have no front light at all (they’re for working, where the environment is presumably well lit) this has 35 leds (I find that excessive, but I’d rather too many than none at all). These lights adjust depending on the ambient light and can become warmer either manually or automatically as the time of day changes. This is ideal for reading in bed or reading before sleep.<br /><br />Technically, I think the e-note devices are faster in response, by an order of a fraction of a millisecond. In practice, this makes no difference.<br /><br />If you want to take notes primarily, go with an e-note. If you want to read primarily, go with an e-reader. If it’s an even split, I think the Scribe is the best experience. You have the option for the most memory with this. You’ll need to do workarounds one way or the other, and this is the least burdensome.<br /><br />Now to compare e-readers. The Kobo is 0.1” larger, so little I can’t count that as a major win. The Scribe offers adjustable light temperatures. While some Kobo do, the Elipsa does not. I’m singling out the Elipsa for its note taking abilities as it’s the closest match to the Scribe. Neither are waterproof, which is odd for both as both have sibling products that are.<br /><br />The Elipsa allows you to search your local library system and download a book right from the device. The Kindle lets you borrow a book, then send from the Amazon page for that book. There are wins on both sides here. For the Kobo, this is far more convenient as long as you only use one library system. You can put a book on hold and check your place in the queue right on the device. However, you can only use one library system. I have a library card for the Brooklyn Public Library and the NYPL. I borrow from both -- a thing Kindle can do, and Kobo can’t.<br /><br />Elipsa doesn’t have Bluetooth, so no headphones and no support for audiobooks (Audible would have been locked into the Amazon family in any case). Scribe works perfectly for Audible, but I have to wonder, given the size of the device, if that’s the best way to listen to audiobooks. I’m not going to score that as a major win. Kobo lets you use DropBox to wirelessly put books on the device, but honestly, Amazon has been winning that game since the start and they continue to win here. There are just too many convenient options.<br /><br />Kobo often has more sales on books, as they are Canadian and not constrained by the agency model, and you can save points for free books, but it looks like Amazon is heading in that direction as well, so that has no clear winner either.<br /><br />For my purposes, I prefer the Scribe for the multiple libraries, for ease of transfer of books, and for how comfortable the device feels.",B0BG1LYRQ3,B0BGN73W4Z,AGLHRQLAWKWQKEF6VRO2Y3MRS4JQ,03:03.1,41,FALSE,5588,5.1,5,5

If it's your primary, your best bet is to partition it before you install Windows.  If you aren't very technical, and just need a replacement drive, you're better off picking up a 2 TB, which is the biggest Win 8 can recognize without such additional configuration.<br /><br />The drive itself is perfect.  It's fast.  It's quiet.  It's reliable--I work in IT, and I've found WD drives over all to cause the fewest problems.

I like that it is a twist action, because it would be hard to pop the cap on the top, and I'd be the kind of idiot who would try to use the stylus with a cap sitting on top of it.<br /><br />The biggest issue I have is that it is not refillable.  There is no way to open it, so far as I can see, thus it's a disposable pen.  This is a bit too pricy for a disposable.<br /><br />A smaller issue is the company name blazoned across it.  It looks like a promo item from a trade show.<br /><br />The stylus is perfect.  It's just firm enough to be precise, and it works splendedly with the Kindle Fire and the iPad.",B005EM6IAA,B005EM6IAA,AGLHRQLAWKWQKEF6VRO2Y3MRS4JQ,27:45.0,2,FALSE,734,5,3,5
5,Really good sound quality.,"I used this for a podcast so that I could hear the person I was interviewing without the microphone picking it up, which would cause a distorted, kind of echo sound.  It worked very well with Skype--the setup was crazy simple.  The sound quality impressed me most of all.  It was very clear, much clearer than I'm used to with bluetooth headsets.  I've tried it with Windows XP Home, Vista Ultimate 32-bit, and Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit and it works fine will all of these.<br /><br />I later set this up with my Droid cell phone.  It hooked up easily and again, it works very well. The battery life is ample, even for a heavy use day. The earpiece is quite comfortable. I connected it to an iPod Touch without a problem, and got really good sound out of it.<br /><br />My only complaint, and this seems true of blue tooth headsets in general, is that the charging plug is about six inches long.  That is way too short, especially if you have all of your outlets on the floor and don't want to put something that's been on the floor in your ear. Otherwise, the device is perfect.

This TV made it very straightforward to do that.<br /><br />It shipped well protected in a box and arrived functional and looking sharp.

5,"Awesome, luxurious feeling product","I've got a couple of Jabra products, and they impress me with their quality and attention to detail.<br /><br />It starts at packaging. They come nicely packaged, but not excessively so. Packaging is recycled, and walks you through unboxing and functionality. There is a nice zippered case that the headphones fold up into. The button layout isn't bad, but could use just a bit more labeling on things like the volume buttons. They aren't entirely intuitive, with a column of three buttons, the top and bottoms being volume, while the middle is used for something else.<br /><br />The headphones are a little smaller and lighter than I expected, but are still made of very nice materials. They have the feeling of a luxury item. Pairing was easy, and if you install the app, it will update firmware for you, walk you through all the functionality and allow you to set button and behavior options.<br /><br />I keep expecting active noise cancellation in a modern, high end product like this to really silence the background. I'd say it does if you are already listening to something with a little volume, but it doesn't really 100% silence the background if you just want to silence the world and have some quiet. That said, it takes things down about 10 notches, which is enough to stop auditory overload if, like me, you are sensitive to having multiple streams of auditory input coming at you at once. After trying about five different noise canceling products in the last six months trying to find the best one, this definitely wins on the noise canceling front.<br /><br />These headphones are optimized toward things like answering calls, but are very good for other uses as well. That said, I have a pair of Jabra's ANC earbuds, and I actually prefer them to these for near everything. They're smaller, less obtrusive, sound nearly as good, and are actually more comfortable.",B08B8XH6V8,B09XC369ZX,AFPF2CONJ33FNFKOEQ2TUNWQJTFQ,14:08.5,0,FALSE,1882,4.2,5,4

Overall, I've been surprised and incredibly impressed with the performance. The recognition is better than with the standard headset that came with the software, and the headset does everything I had hoped.<br /><br />There's a volume control button on the cord, and the USB cord is about 8 feet long, which is plenty generous for connecting to my computer and doing speech recognition.<br /><br />The only problem with this headset is that I want to use it for hours on end while narrating articles. I'm a freelance writer, and sometimes I either just don't feel like typing, have a sore wrist or fingers, or feel like I can narrate my thoughts faster than I can type them. After about two hours of using this headset, my ears start to ache. I haven't figured out any way of changing the tension on this headset so it doesn't press so hard on my ears.<br /><br />While I would definitely recommend this headset as a low-budget alternative to higher end products, and for people who would like to use a headset for just an hour or so at a time, I would not recommend it for people who want to use the headset for any kind of professional or serious hobby endeavor. I can see from other reviews that I'm not alone in having my ears hurt, and since I have a small size head, and ears that do not stick out very far, I can only think the problem would be worse for most people than it is for me.",B000UXZQ42,B0BS1615YC,AFPF2CONJ33FNFKOEQ2TUNWQJTFQ,52:59.0,2,TRUE,1498,3.4,4,3

3,"Do NOT use if you take online classes, easy setup, nice size","I like to stay versed in PC, plus I don’t want to take my crazy expensive MacBook Pro to school and risk it getting stolen or dropped. I’m taking the price difference into account for the review, as expecting a $825~ to perform or look like a $3,500 one would be unreasonable.<br /><br />Here are some details on how this computer performed:<br /><br />Once set up, I like to test computers with nothing on them to see how they do in a best case scenario where the hard drive isn’t loaded with a lot of files, videos, music, pics, etc.<br /><br />Setup was fast and easy, and the option to have a semi touchless setup with Cortana was very cool.<br /><br />The size is great, making this work as a desktop or laptop, and for its luxurious screen size, it weighs very little and is quite streamlined, taking up as much width as a medium sized notebook. Screen resolution is ok. It’s not a retina or high definition screen, by any means, nor is it great for reading small text, but for everything else, it works fine!<br /><br />The issue is speed. I compared watching a simple video online with this computer versus my iPhone X on the same network, and it took this computer Massively more time. The same video took a few seconds to be able to fully play seamlessly on my phone and literally over 2 minutes on the PC on the same WiFi network with stops for buffering. I had to sit and wait or it would play a little then buffer and stop repeatedly. No good!<br /><br />I take online classes, and since I saw how slowly this was performing, I opted to only try timed quizzes and items when at home with my laptop on standby. Glad I did. I tried to start a timed quiz, and it wasn’t loading, but the problem is that it opened the page, initiating the quiz. I watched with anxiety as the buttons sloooooowly appeared without text. Since I’d never had to refresh the page for one of these in the years I’ve done online classes, I wasn’t sure what would happen, but I had no choice. I refreshed...and waited again...and the timer started, but there was no text. I am so grateful it let me pick up from my Mac, because after minutes of failed attempts on the PC, it loaded effortlessly on my 5-year-old Mac. What’s more, this dinosaur of a computer is almost full of videos and music and files (I’m in entertainment, so the MacBook Pro is a necessity more than a luxury). The 1 terabyte hard drive has a handful of gigs, maybe 30-50, and yet it had no problem loading this page.<br /><br />So yeah. I don’t trust this computer. It has good battery life, looks fine, has a nice screen (it’s not retina, but it’s fine for everyday stuff), but between the pop ups and the incredibly slow speed, I can’t recommend this to anyone depending on their computer for reliable speeds and any online work.",B07PZQ9LSN,B07PZQ9LSN,AH5HSMUMRJRDWBPFDQ6G3EAAOSFQ,12:07.0,4,FALSE,2786,5.1,3,5

5,Budget Friendly Gaming Improvement,"I am a little impressed with this monitor. I didn’t think I would notice a difference because I am not a gamer but I can actually say that this is more vibrant and clear. My boys are not old enough to be serious about their games and I must say that I would prefer it if they were outside doing things then inside on a computer but I am a firm believer in supporting their passions and interests. So I paired this monitor with a Dell gaming pc. They did say that their gaming has improved since receiving this and I think they are right. The resolution is a major plus and definitely the biggest part of making this look so great. The flickerless technology for reducing eye strain is the reason for my monitor change. I am always worrying about the kids ruining their eyes because they are spending so much time on it so this feature is a must for my household. This screen size is ideal because it is just big enough not to be overwhelming. I have not noticed any lagging or glitches so far and I believe the response time is a lot better. This was a snap to setup and since this is a frame less display, it would be perfect for multi monitor setups. I’m still not quite sure about the AMD FreeSync technology but I do notice that the refresh rate has improved and there has not been any stuttering.  I think for now this momma bear did pretty good on setting up a decent gaming experience on a budget for my boys and as long as they are passing they can play.",B07V7GJR9S,B07WYJXGJ8,AFPFSWOQKMB23WJPUFIMHEH46BCA,28:51.3,0,FALSE,1462,3.6,5,4

5,I love these earbuds!,"I got these just before Christmas 2021. I found them for an insane sale,  and snagged them up.  I had been wanting a quality pair of earbuds because I love kissing to audio books while I game on my phone in the middle of the night.  I had been buying random mid range ear buds for too long and honestly thought that the sub par performance was just normal.  Imagine my delight when I put these in! Wow! It was like I was transported into another world! The sound is literally better than real life! The sound is so crisp,  no static,  no struggle to understand,  they literally give me better hearing,  well better hearing whatever I'm listening to! Lol, sucks when I take them off! 🤣 anyways I do have one complaint, and it's a crazy one, I can't walk with both of them in.  Nope can't do it,  I mean I can but it's really really hard.  I'm 45, not 80, I think it's because of how well the noise cancelation works. There is no sound from the outside world at all. Snoring, babies crying, sidewalk construction,  police ambulance firetruck,  heck my family knows you have to touch me if you need me. While it's amazingly good at silencing the world,  the lack of feedback is you aren't used to it can make you seriously dizzy... I often find myself wearing just 1 bud at a time,  which doubles the wear time.  I can wear these for 8-10 hours before they start complaining that the battery is low. They charge fast tho, so that's good.  I'm overall very happy with these earbuds! But a cute pink case or accessories is nonexsistant! I can only find red, black, green, or blue silicone covers.  That makes me so sad! Pink glittery hello kitty on a Keychain please!!!!!

5,Wonderful for what I wanted it for!,"I am in love with this projector, I've always wanted one and finally caved in! Definitely should have sooner!<br />The set-up of this projector was simple (I'm talking plug it in and push play easy). The box and its contents all look great quality, even the buttons and inputs on the projector itself have a good solid feel.<br />After using it for a while, the projector has not had any heat issues. The fan air blows out the sides and seems to be doing a great job at keeping the unit cool.<br />I have my Roku connected to it through the HDMI ports and it works great! Whether I want to watch Disney+, YouTube, HBO, or any other service I haven't come across any issues. The quality is fine no matter what service I'm watching, the sound from the projector is really good I have no need to connect it to a separate speaker since I think the projector speakers are perfectly fine. (This projector also supports headphones being plugged directly into the back which also has great sound quality! Especially for watching late-night movies without disturbing others lol)<br />The projector is bright enough that it's still very clear and visible when other lights in the room are on, but I would still recommend as close to full darkness when viewing. The only thing I did find slightly annoying was the fact that the projector remote does not come with batteries (2 AAA), and this remote controls the volume which I wasn't able to change without it. But that's not a big issue, and otherwise, I'd strongly recommend this projector for a great movie/tv show-watching experience!

I do still use them, but mostly just the right one because it stays in my ear better than the left.  Sound quality is decent, but the volume system on it is weird.

I'm using it on my work computer because it likes to shut down instead of sleep if I don't use it for a while.  So I need it to stay awake.<br /><br />My only con is I have to remove it when working on anything that I need the mouse to change on, such as spreadsheets where I want to get the drag & drop cursor to show up.

2,Make the Next Step if you Can,"Only 2 days into ownership so the hard stuff comes up front, 12 hours of Windows 8 updates to 8.1 and the object-throwing rage that Windows 8 creates.  Is it that bad?  Yes. (Exhibit A. who in the entire human population ever asked Microsoft to get rid of the X button, was this trivial little button causing some unknown global problem?  It's removal is a major concern).  OK, so is this ASUS' fault?  Well, yes, they partook in the KoolAid that says you can't offer a mainstream Windows 7 box anymore.  You can and should, ship it with Windows 8 upgrade if necessary.<br /><br />Back to the ASUS.  I had my reservations because what I really wanted was an MSI GE60 or 70, but was constrained by a business budget.  The major differences (beyond an unnecessarily better video card) were 3: the MSI has a backlit keyboard, 7200rpm drive, and Windows 7.  These differences have all produced regrets.  Every fear of a non-backlit keyboard have been realized here and had I seen this laptop live before buying, this alone would have killed the purchase.  The print on the keys is very thin with poor contrast and tiny alternates, thus very difficult to see.  Why ASUS?  See no reason for this simple oversight.  All of the 6 keyboards in my home are readable in low light.  This one, not so much.  The 5400 drive is slow (confirmed with its lagging score on Windows Experience Index), not sure a 7200 is going to make a remarkable difference, but for now, it's a regret.  And of course Windows 8.<br /><br />Still, initially gave 3-stars because this package more or less delivers what it purports too.  Construction feels good, display looks good, the various spec parts seem to behave well together.  The layout is no-nonsense with a good array of connections.  Bloat-ware was manageable.  The video card surely is not worth the $200 premium over the identical ASUS without it.  Get that Asus for productivity, it is a bargain.<br /><br />Overall, cannot escape the feeling that this laptop is no better than one I could buy 3 years ago, not how I want to feel at this mid-price point.<br /><br />UPDATE: after some unsatisfactory graphics output, checked in to things and am finding that the built-in HD Graphics are being used in conjunction with the installed NVIDIA, often taking precedence over the NVIDIA.  You have little to no control over this, it is Intel likely trying to be smarter than you presumably to save battery.  In most cases it will cross over under load, but you will notice the degradation for a few seconds before the transition, and it is aggravating.  In other cases, the fix never happens.  I have one piece of software that will not allow me to even run a certain function because it says I have no graphics card.  I tried to get around that setting by loading the card down before going into that software.  Then it detects the card.  However, on reboot I am back to ground zero with the function disabled.  Considering the NVIDIA graphics cards raises the price of this laptop $200 over the identical ASUS, it goes without saying that I regret this purchase.<br /><br />I have experienced several freeze ups and a complete failure of the graphics card to run a single 1080 monitor with a modest visualizer.  I have decided to return this an upgrade to an MSI with a better graphics card.",B00DXFF6QC,B00DXFF6QC,AF55YOQVWHFUI3BJLOVGFCAFZ63Q,41:02.0,4,TRUE,3316,4.7,2,5

3,"Excellent quality, but disappointing fit","NOTE: I received a free sample of this tank top for review.<br /><br />I like layering tanks under shirts and even dresses, but it can be difficult to find high-quality tank tops for this purpose.  This Ultimate Slimming Tank Top from Nudwear is definitely excellent quality.  The combination 84% Nylon/16% Elastane was substantial and opaque, even in the white version.  Furthermore, the fabric was smooth with plenty of stretch.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the fit was more of a disappointment.  Because I wear a small or medium in most tops, I ordered a medium (given the stretch, I didn't want the top to be TOO tight).  This tank definitely fit me close to the body.  I wouldn't say that it was bandage-tight, but at the same time, it was clingy enough that I would wear it alone as suggested in the description.<br /><br />Despite the close fit through the torso and waist area (keeping in mind that I'm pretty slim there--my natural waistline is only about 27-28""), the straps on this top were a bit too long and too loose on me.  Although I did like thicker-style straps, I did NOT like that they weren't adjustable like tanks with spaghetti-style straps.  Furthermore, I was disappointed that this tank had NO shaping around the bust whatsoever.  A final fit issue I had was with the wide waistband.  Although I believe this was designed to keep the top down, I actually found that it caused it to ride up!  The only way this top stayed in place is when I had it tucked into my pants.<br /><br />In the end, I think the description of this top as ""slimming"" is misleading; perhaps ""smoothing"" would have been more accurate?  I would have found this tank top to be MUCH more practical if it had an actually slimming panel in the tummy area--a built-in bra would have been nice as well (or at least some sort of shirring or other enhancement to the bustline).  Perhaps this tank will work for others, but I would not recommend it for a woman of my similar shape and size.",B00I2U16Q2,B00I2U16Q2,AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA,35:50.0,1,FALSE,1976,4.3,3,4

3,Pretty Purple Color - Lightweight But Feels Cheaply Made,"I love the color and it's smooth to the touch, but it looks more durable on screen than in person. It's made of two parts - the cover is very thin and feels like cardboard that's been covered up with a thin layer of plastic (painted to look like faux purple leather) with the inside sporting a thin, microfiber interior.  The second half is made of hard, cheap plastic (they call it a &#34;polycarbonate shell&#34; to make it sound fancier).<br /><br />If it wasn't made specifically for the Fire 6, I doubt it would sell for as much as it does.  As it is, I will use it as a decorative case for my Kindle Fire but it feels very cheaply made, so I would handle it very carefully.",B00LNK3TK4,B00LIC2FHA,AH3BXW7KLIS2VAE56UXJS2NS7I5A,25:40.0,6,FALSE,679,2.5,3,3
4,Shampoo-Shaped Radio Works Well For a Long Time on Two Batteries,"Updated review:<br /><br />I've become somewhat dependent on the sight of this bright blue radio. Every morning I stumble, groggy-eyed, into my bathroom. Having this clear-sounding radio, blasting my favorite music, is a nice pick-me-up as I shower. But does the design offer me anything more than what I would expect from a typical shower radio?<br /><br />PROS: It's cleverly designed to mimic the shape of a shampoo. It melds easily into the background. My initial fear was that I would accidentally grab it instead of the real thing, but so far that hasn't happened.<br /><br />PROS: The sound quality is tinny but quite decent for a shower radio.<br /><br />PROS: The radio offers a ""store"" function where you can bookmark your favorite radio stations and get to them fast by using a ""recall"" button. This is a feature common to most clock radios but I don't spend enough time in the bathroom to use it. I basically stick to one station while showering and can't see myself using the ""store"" function unless I'm taking a long bath. Still, nice to have that option.<br /><br />PROS: Great battery life! I used my AA batteries for this and it has been running for months with no problem.<br /><br />CONS: It's not that easy to see the buttons. They're located on the sides of the device but the positions are not intuitive. I always have to squint a little to see the print above the buttons because the buttons do not stick out.<br /><br />CONS: ""Light up"" function. The time display is very clear and easy to read as-is. Since it's not a bedtime clock radio that benefits from having a glow-in-the-dark function, this feature feels extraneous to me. Perhaps it's best for someone who likes to take a bath with candles all around.<br /><br />CONS: Not space saving. I used to have a shower radio that could be hooked over the showerhead. While the radio is not huge, I still had to move my shampoo and conditioner bottles to make room for it.<br /><br />Overall it is a decent radio and I have been using it since I got it with no problems.",B007JR55KC,B008DS16SG,AH3BXW7KLIS2VAE56UXJS2NS7I5A,57:31.0,0,FALSE,2044,5.1,4,5
4,Great for Listening to Youtube Videos on Your Netbook,"PROS: Easy to set up. All I had to do was plug the included Bluetooth wireless device into a USB on my Toshiba Windows 7 netbook. Soon I had the pleasure of listening to Youtube videos and my iTunes library through a thumping subwoofer and two speakers.<br /><br />If you don't expect BOSE quality-like sound, a decent set of speakers for the price. At high levels the sound does get a little tinny, but still represents a major improvement over the sound of the typical speakers provided with a PC. The set is particularly useful if you're throwing a party in your small apartment and want to use your iTunes library as the source.<br /><br />CONS:<br />The title of the product is misleading. It is not a true ""wireless"" device in the sense that the subwoofer and speaker are wired and have to be plugged into an outlet. However, I didn't mind this as many truly ""wireless"" devices often require batteries or have to be recharged at some point.<br /><br />Do we need such a big fat subwoofer/speaker? It looks weird being sandwiched between two little ones. The trio takes up a lot of space and is awkward to store. I would rather have had two moderately-sized speakers with good bass. Also, the right speaker is permanently wired to the back of the subwoofer, while the left one is detachable. I would have preferred two detachable speakers.<br /><br />The instructions are poorly laid out. Instead of having one or two manuals (i.e., one for a quick set-up, one with more detail), the manufacturer chose to scatter the instructions across several small booklets. One had a diagram showing how to connect it with an analog connection while another little booklet showed you how to connect wirelessly. Yet another listed the customary safety warnings and warranty.

5,Very Good case - All pros no cons,"Very Nice Case<br />Pros:<br />* The case base is hard making the kindle safe and secure. I drop tested it and felt that I would not damage my device.<br />* The case is not slick and shiny like a lot of cases. It has a matte finish with a felt like texture. This makes the case easy to hold.<br />  My other cases are leather and I have dropped my devices because of the smooth surface. I don't buy leather cases any more<br />* This case is easy to keep clean. Any case gets dropped on the floor at home or in restaurants. I like being able to clean my case.<br />  Some how the ketchup always finds it's way on to everything I am wearing or holding. The case I bought was black. So far, no stains.<br />* It comes in a variety of colors. Most products like this only come in black. I tend to place a color strip on it so I can find it. I like my black<br />  case, but if I were to buy it again, I would buy a brighter color. Just easier to find inside the  black hole I call my purse.<br />  * At first I did not know how I would like the stand, however, I have found it very useful. I like to take notes and found this easy to read with the stand up. I will look for this in other cases.<br />* Magnets along the edge keep the cover closed. Even on a drop test or in my purse it stays closed. The cover is strong enough that I feel my<br />  screen is safe.<br />Cons:  .<br />* Can't really find any cons with this case. The hinge (usually a weak point ) is flexible yet durable enough to last a good long time. I have a screen protector on all my devices because I tend to drop everything. I would still suggest it, however, the cover for this should keep you screen safe.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount or for free in exchange for my honest review.",B00YHANFEM,B00YHANFEM,AEGW7EZC5QYVIVNGNLPW5JCQSXMA,24:02.0,0,FALSE,1771,4,5,4

4,"Great, with minor flaws","Have had this for a month or so now - upgraded from a Sony 34 in CRT HDTV.<br /><br />The picture quality, 3D and regular HD, is excellent.  I compared this to the top of the line Samsung side by side in a specialty store, and the difference in quality, though not much, was perceptible to my average joe eyes in fast moving scenes. If picture quality is your key consideration, then you will have no regrets with the Panasonic. Also, I purchased this primarily for 2d viewing - this tv has the best 2d picture out there.<br />Setup was  a breeze - no complaints there either.<br /><br />Now for the minor quibbles:<br /><br />I wasn't happy with the 4 preset picture settings - the THX was a bit too `dim' for regular TV viewing (it's fine when watching blu-ray stuff), and the vivid was, well, too vivid. I had to mess around and find a sweet spot between these 2, and create my own custom setting.<br /><br />The TV isn't to great with detecting the source format size - if you `zoomed' in to watch a 4:3 aspect DVD on the full screen, and switch to cable HD, the picture stays zoomed.  My 8 year old Sony was able to figure this out, so why can't this top of the line plasma?<br /><br />The plain Jane design sucks - for a top of the line plasma TV, one would have expected a bit more classier design, than  plastic black/brown strips on 4 sides. (the Samsung beats the Panasonic hands down in this category)<br /><br />There are USB ports on the sides, conveniently located to charge the 3D glasses (good idea!). However, they do not charge when the TV is on standby mode.  You would assume the circuitry could have been deigned to power the usb ports, even when the main TV is off ?<br /><br />The `free' 3d glasses provided with the TV suck - they don't fit either of my 2 young daughters, and let a lot of ambient light in from the sides, which not only distracts, but also reflects off the glasses into your eyes. (a further distraction).  To be fair, the TV has nothing to do with this issue!)<br /><br />The user interface for youtube and Netflix is passable, but a bit of pain to use and search through.(I queue up my Netflix online movies using my laptop,  and then navigate using the on-screen app.).<br /><br />Lastly, a comment about all 3d tvs - while a 50 inch size is `large', by any standards, it looks small when watching 3D, I suppose this is because objects look further away in 3d.

2,"Poor value, sad decline of Netgear","I'm writing this review with a very heavy heart. I have been loyal to Netgear routers since 2007. Always reliable and bullet proof. But ever since I purchased Nighthawks, I've grown increasingly unhappy with the quality of software and customer service. The last straw came when I updated the firmware (see Netgear communities - lots of unhappy peeps). The Nighthawk AC2300 5g connection crashed DAILY. I finally shut it off, but 2g was also unreliable. We were resetting the router every couple of days. Several factory resets later, and I'm done. Oh, and did I add that there's no fix for this current version of the firmware. Netgear support is absolutely silent on this issue. Tired of giving up Sunday mornings troubleshooting router problems. So... I'm giving up and bailing on brand loyalty. I bought a 1-month subscription to Consumer Reports. Incidentally... I've also tried TP-NET and Asus. Cheap routers are definitely NOT the way to go. Plus, they have leaky security, which, in these times of hacks and ransomware, doesn't do it for me. Hope this helps.",B07K3Z892V,B09L9QTW5J,AHIEORDUWYCDFXQOG4VLQSDLQVIQ,20:53.7,5,TRUE,1066,4.6,2,5

The ability for it to record to an SD card is perfect for me needs of always being on the road, or even doing mobile gaming. The software is very well written, with lots of control over the audio and video settings really makes this stream line into my production and post production workflow.<br /><br />I love that it can run off of USB, this allows me to use my portable USB chargers so this device is truly mobile. That along with the fact that I can run this capture on any piece of hardware because it uses USB 2.0, but still allows up to 60Mbps which gives me broadcast quality out of the HDMI. This is really what my production needed as a backup hdmi recorder that has pass through. But with the xsplit trial also makes this perfect for doing my let's plays.

With the adjustable clamps on this power strip, it easily and securely attaches to the edge of desk, table, or bench.  It has plenty of power options w/three 110V outlets and 2 USB outlets; as well as one CAT6 outlet for Ethernet connections and one HDMI outlet.  I particularly like that this strip has an HDMI outlet, so that I can just plug straight into this port rather than try to plug into the back of a wall mounted TV or chase a fallen cord down by my desk or bench.  I could not find another desk mounted power strip that included an HDMI port, so that made picking this one an easy choice.  W/the clamps, there is no need to breakout a hole saw and make a mess of your desk or bench to mount this strip like a number of other power strips or stations would require.  The price is good at around $35.  I would definitely recommend this power strip to anyone.",B07R4VMWMP,B07R4VMWMP,AG3BUKTFR5GHARWD4HI3B26YRNSQ,23:09.0,2,TRUE,1105,3.2,5,3
5,Great Noise Cancelling Headphones,"My work bought each person in my branch a pair of QC25’s from Amazon.

I also use them for work, not just at work.<br /><br />Since I have both a pair of the old and new, I thought I’d do my own comparison:<br /><br />1.  Equally comfortable<br /><br />2.  In a quiet environment, where noise cancelling isn’t really a factor, I think the sound quality (even of the older QC2’s) is pretty comparable.  If I were thinking about upgrading just for sound quality, I don’t think I would.<br /><br />3.  Noise cancelling has definitely improved in the QC25’s over the older QC2’s.  In a noisey environment where noise cancelling matters, the difference is noticeable.  The QC2’s are good, the QC25’s are clearly better.<br /><br />4.  The QC25’s will work w/o a battery.  If the battery dies in the QC25, you will have music, just not NC.  In the older QC2’s, the headphones would not work at all w/a dead or no battery.<br /><br />5.  QC25’s have a mic for taking or making phone calls.  The QC2’s did not.<br /><br />6.  The case is smaller, but just as protective for the QC25’s.  The QC2’s do not fold up as small.<br /><br />7.  They both look good.<br /><br />8.  The prices really haven’t changed over the years.<br /><br />The bottom line, I love my Bose headsets, both of them. I would absolutely recommend buying a set, particularly if you have a need for a set of quality headphones at work or for travel.<br /><br />For me, after reviewing the older and newer QC headsets, I don’t think I’d upgrade until the older QC2’s stopped working.  I think that Bose headsets are built so well, that time doesn’t diminish the quality and utility of Bose’s older products.",B00M1NEUKK,B0105VDCZ8,AG3BUKTFR5GHARWD4HI3B26YRNSQ,01:12.3,0,FALSE,1823,5,5,5

2,One weak point,"The first mount I ordered failed to hold my monitor up properly. However, I liked this mount, so I decided to exchange it. The second mount holds my monitor at the right height, but there's a problem with the angle.<br /><br />The mount uses friction at the point where the mount screws into your monitor to hold the monitor at the desired angle. It's a bit tough to describe, but it's basically a plastic disk that slides around in a metal cup to hold the monitor at the right angle.<br /><br />The problem is that, over time, the monitor starts to angle down, to a point at which it is angled down severely. At first, this was gradual and I would have to readjust the angle every couple of hours. After a few weeks, I now have to readjust the angle every few minutes. This is intolerable.<br /><br />I contacted their support department some weeks ago. At first, I called. However, the man I spoke with seemed to have no clue which product I was talking about and didn't even recognize the name EchoGear, let alone the specific product itself. After about 2-3 minutes, he did manage to find the product manual on his end. However, he failed to understand the behavior I was describing over the phone and suggested that email would be a better way to receive support. He also asked me to send in pictures.<br /><br />I typed out a several page long email and included pictures. I even drew a simple diagram to make sure the behavior was fully understandable. 3 weeks later, I have yet to receive any reply from support or even an acknowledgment that my email was received.<br /><br />Overall, I like the look of this monitor stand. I really wanted a wall mount, as my desk is small and I didn't want to clamp anything to my desk.<br /><br />Sadly, I will have to return this replacement, as the stand fails to hold my monitor at the right angle. Their support is, in my experience, worthless and both have no idea what they're doing and/or fails to reply to help requests. 2 monitor stands from EchoGear - the first failed to work entirely and the second fails to hold my monitor at the right angle.<br /><br />I should note that my monitor is about a pound less than the maximum weight described. If you were using a smaller, lighter monitor, you might not have the issues I've described.<br /><br />At any rate, I cannot recommend this particular mount and would suggest exploring alternatives.",B079NNC8N8,B079NNC8N8,AHISDEDXLXH36EH7JSU5R6QHEUAQ,16:45.8,21,TRUE,2397,2.2,2,2

On spy shows the agents have these tiny comm devices they put in their ears... these are about that size.<br /><br />I got these for listening to sounds when I sleep.  I've tried several other brands and even the smallest ones I purchased had some slight discomfort.  These did not.  The rubber on the  outside is very soft.  I knew they were there but didn't wake up with any ear pain.  They also didn't fall out all night.  There's a couple bags of different size ear caps and ear tips but I used the ones that came on them and they were fine.  Sometimes when I take out an earbud the rubber tip will pop off and stay in my ear.  But I suspect if I try another size ear tip I could fix that.<br /><br />Connectivity was not an issue.  Just worked.  And unlike the other brand I reviewed, both ears have a good solid connection, even when in my ear sandwiched between my skull and the pillow.<br /><br />Noise cancellation - with the eartips fitting in tight, it does provide more noise cancellation than I expected.  Not active but it dulls the outside world a bit.<br /><br />The only downside is that the sound is a little thin. There's not a lot of low end.  And the max volume isn't blasting loud.

1,Once great product and support. Now garbage.,"Apr 2021 - Dropped from 4 to 5 stars. Don't buy this unit unless prepared for hours of work and pain. Issues in past 6 months alone,: hot swap didn't work leading to a clean install, qumagie began degrading entire system until inaccessible..plus upon password reset qumagie vm was completely blown away, multiple time qumagie lost all facial recognition....<br /><br />Then there is support. QNAP support has gone completely to s**t. Once top of their game/best. Now, they are completely useless.<br /><br />Sept 30/17- 4th time now I have encountered my unit dying after firmware updates. 2 were due to my own stupidity going to a beta build for a feature. But, 2 were after release builds. The unit becomes inaccessible within 1-7 days of update. In all prior instances, I was told to wait for a new build to resolve which typically came quickly. For over a week now, I have been jacked around by a support rep. politely telling me i am on crack. What is really troubling is that qnap doesn't seem to have a proper crm for tracking both calls, chat and emails. In other words, they don't have my history. Not impressed with both the crappy firmware updates and the lack of accountability in support. Ratings downgrade..<br /><br />Setup seemed reasonably simple until I tried to update applications and/or install new ones. Seems to be an issue with Router.<br />I have zero patience for crappy support and waiting 15 minutes just to be deferred to email (which has a 24 hour possible wait) is completely unacceptable. If I don't get an answer or resolve this within 24 hours, this is gone.<br /><br />4/1/16 - Still no response from support but found my issue. (absolutely crap support) If you choose to use drive encryption, make sure you unlock or you can't install. The error messages leading to no online source were a red herring. Errors are not very intuitive. Installation of myQNAPcloud has been going on for over an hour on 5TB.<br /><br />5/11/16- I started to make some progress on my own and decided to keep the unit. What a mistake.. the android apps constantly &#34;stop working&#34; when not even used, caregorization of videos on pc is great but good luck filtering on android...you get everything. Music management and the android  app suck.  Still cannot get vpn client working with PIA PPTP or OpenVPN..support is still incredibly  slow and useless and has been voted worst support of any tech product 2016 (by me).<br /><br />7/1/16 - Revised my review upward and here is why..<br />1. Found out myself (technician was shocked) that I can indeed point Firefly (iTunes Server) to M3U playlist I exported from my iTunes Library and it works. - Music issues solved.<br />2. PIA VPN over PPTP is now working flawlessly<br />3. Video App still cannot seperate formats correctly (home video from movies). Technician indicated known issue and will be resolved in future releases<br />4. Streaming to TV. Get 8 gb. Do not buy the 2 gb on it's own...You need 8 gb to get the needed performance in my opinion.<br /><br />7/12/19 - QNAP has come a very long way..<br /><br />The OS has really improved over the past 2 years. It is more manageable and easier to navigate. Updates have worked without a hitch for the past year.  The unit itself is still pounding away. The only thing I wish now is that I had a faster processor and a better music management system. I still do not like the Music Station and not paying a subscription for any other.",B015VNLEOQ,B07STLVG75,AHOXIUCQNEJ5X5YQSXDP35Z4E7LA,48:45.0,7,TRUE,3458,5.3,1,5
3,Great product and price ..if it worked and if the support site was up..,Good points:<br />- Price point<br />- General quality and functionality except (see below)<br />- Mobile access - Alot of apps seem to have some degree of support for the product<br /><br />Bad points:<br />- Motion does not work correctly. It spews pictures at the rate set in alert intervals for zero movement<br />- Support site is down to validate firmware. 404 message is NOT 'kewl'. Not sure if this company is going under..but this is not acceptable..<br /><br />I plan to return this product if I cannot get the motion working correctly (which was definitely part of the reason for the purchase).<br /><br />UPDATE: I updated the firmware to the latest build (1.7.19 1.7) found on the Tenvis forums as the website seems to still be in maintenance mode. Looks like the motion detection is now working correctly.

3,DEAD after 3 months. Poor quality control or a lemon?,"I bought this because I needed a flexible low profile cable for a hidden cable run. I was very happy with it but then it completely stopped working after 3 months. I've never had an hdmi cable (even cheap free ones) fail so I'm pretty disappointed that it stopped working, especially at this price point. I haven't had a chance to hook up the replacement since it's going to be really time consuming to remove all the cable anchors from the original run and replace with the new cable.<br /><br />Support was quick to respond via email and sent me a replacement which tracking showed as delivered but nothing ever showed. They thankfully sent out a second replacement which arrived. I'm concerned about an out of warranty failure down the line but only time will tell.<br /><br />I'd give it 5 stars if the price were more reasonable and it never failed so I'm giving it 2 stars + 1 star for the good customer service.

2,Recent purchase of Samsung Gear Fit 2,"I bought this last week knowing it was a brand new product with the understanding that it wouldn't be perfect. I read the reviews before me that gave me some heads up on the device. So far, I really like it. It's pretty easy to use and figure out, even without the manual. It seems accurate on miles, steps, sleep, etc., but I don't have anything to compare it to.  Although, it seems like I'm burning a lot more calories than I should be. But I'm not an expert on the average calories burned in a day.<br /><br />What I like:<br />Easy to use.<br />Sleep tracker is great.<br />The music player is awesome.<br />The design.<br />How it lights up with the flick of the wrist.<br /><br />What I would have liked to see:<br />They have several types of workouts to select from. I would like to see something for contact sport but I use &#34;Other Workout&#34; and I don't know how accurate it is or what is measures/uses to accurately count calories burned.<br />It is hard to see in the sun.<br />I don't really understand the email notifications. You receive emails and you can reply to them but you can't really check them when you want.<br /><br />Overall, I like it and plan on sticking with it. One important thing to note, if you're interested in purchasing this, is that you need to make sure that:<br /><br />1. Your phone is an Android with a version of 4.4, or if you have a Galaxy, version 4.3.; and<br />2. Make sure your phone supports at least 1.5GB of RAM (My phone did not support this so I ended up buying a cheap phone that did)<br /><br />Other than that, it's pretty good so far. I hope this review helps!<br /><br />UPDATE AFTER 1 YEAR: Over the course of this time frame, the watch constantly fell off my wrist everytime I worked out or did normal activity. The band is so light so forget you have it on. Finally after a year,  I found myself mourning the loss of my watch. It fell off unnoticeably while I was walking through a city sightseeing. I will not be buying this watch again until they fix this issue. It's a shame because the product itself is nice.

1,"Feels Cheap, Bad Connection, Bad for typists, Bad Key programming, Uses old software","I bought this because someone recommended it as a ""typists keyboard.""  The ergonomics are fine, but the keys are mushy and cheap as heck.  I get a lot of repeats and pauses because the connection to the Logitech dongle is crappy.  That seems to be special to this keyboard because the logitech mouse that uses the same dongle is right next to me and has no problem.  It has a lot of programmable keys but there are too many limitations on what they can do.  You can't program a key for multiple key presses.  You can't program them to open different apps (maybe someone has figured out how to make the music key open spotify?  Let me know).  It just feels like it's a toy keyboard.  Not meant for doing work.  It is the worst keyboard I've used from Logitech. And that's saying something.  I have a $20 Lenovo keyboard.  I thought this would be an upgrade from the reviews, but I type 20% faster (I checked) with fewer errors on the Lenovo.",B002MMY4WY,B002MMY4WY,AG5V3EY3MHETL2PGND5V23E56AFQ,51:49.6,0,TRUE,940,4.1,1,4
4,Great Lens for the $ (You can get it for less than $200 on Amazon),"I purchased this lens on Amazon offered by a gray market vendor for $140 (new!).  Gray Market means there is no USA Warranty.  I haven't tried to see if it is eligible, but I assume it would not be.  As of this writing (10/12/2014), that vendor, CD Supply, is still offering the lens - though now for $170.  Still an incredible deal for this lens which came new in the standard Canon box with manual etc. (If it isn't warranteed - I can buy another and still be about the price of just one at regular price).<br /><br />The lens itself:  I was pleasantly surprised.  I could have purchased it in my kit with the 70D camera, but wasn't really interested.  For $140 - what the heck.  The photos are sharper than from the kit 18-135mm STM IS lens in my opinion (and that's a pretty decent lens as kit lenses go).  It is very small and light weight for a pretty long lens - especially on a crop sensor.<br />BONUS:  Macro.  It actually can get pretty decent magnification.  Something like 1/4:1  from a pretty good distance at 250mm.<br />Plus it works great with extension tubes.  I've used it with 12mm and 26mm (not together) and it worked great.  Even autofocus - though I wouldn't recommend that for Macro.<br /><br />Negatives (though - again - if you get it for cheap, these are quibbles):<br />- No lens hood provided.  Buy a knock off on Amazon for $13<br />- Not a super bright lens.  You're going to need some decent sunlight or a good flash with this.  It ramps up to f/5 minimum pretty quick and f/5.6 not too long after that.  Only the widest shots will get F/4.<br />- Pretty cheaply built (but it's a cheap lens!)",B00EFILVQU,B078GM723Q,AG5V3EY3MHETL2PGND5V23E56AFQ,44:38.0,17,FALSE,1625,5,4,5

4,Good for what I needed it for,"I needed another charger and I figured I'd try this.  I have a Samsung laptop and it charges it just fine.

You can also charge your notebook/laptop and extra device simultaneously.<br /><br />So far, it is working fine (but we only had it for a couple of weeks).  I also feel like it doesn't get as hot as the original adapter but that is my opinion.<br /><br />Overall,  if you need a new AC adapter why not try it.

5,"Super cute, space-saving and performs great","The biggest draw for me about these speakers is the space-saving. They are super cute and take up very little space. My desk is very small and my console takes up the majority of the space since I lay it on its side in order to have my monitor, which is rather large, also fit within the desk space by placing it on top of the prone tower. The height of the speakers does not hide anything vital showing on the monitor as they also sit on top of the tower. They can easily go elsewhere even though they are not wireless, because the cords are a good length. I just like having them within arms' reach for the volume control, which is easy to adjust with a knob turn.

5,Great Case,This is a great case that fits my Kindle Fire HDX 7 perfectly. The reason I bought this case was because I hated the case that originally came with my device and I didn't want to pay the big bucks to get a new one. The roocase holds my device either horizontally or vertically and has many nice features for a great price. I got the red and it is beautiful. I had a little difficulty figuring out how to remove the outer cover (no directions included) in order to use the attached legs on the inner plastic holder. These little legs put your Kindle at the perfect angle for typing on it. It is very easy to use your Kindle in either direction by squeezing and turning the knob on the back. This is also the way to remove the outer cover for using your Kindle without it. I am very happy with my purchase.,B00OU6YQU0,B01LXV9D72,AEIUPBYBQH6WNZT7OXURV3ZQDODQ,16:16.0,0,FALSE,804,4.5,5,5
5,Easy-to-use addition to my solar learning experience,"I've been wanting to figure out how to take advantage of solar power, but I've got a lot to learn. I've been picking up pieces of this and that to try to understand what connects with what. The first thing I learned is that I want to pick up DC versions of things like fans and water pumps because these can be connected straight into my 60w and 100w foldable camping solar panels. I've got a solar-connectible camping generator that also has both AC and DC outlets; if I've got my only DC in/outs in use, I can plug this adapter into an AC outlet on the generator and run additional DC devices. I can also run those devices in the house using this adapter plugged into a wall outlet.<br /><br />I'm a mildly dyslexic, hands-on learner; reading books or trying to visualize how things work doesn't cut it for me. I am still bewildered by volts and watts and amps, as well as the different types of plug types, but the more things like this I can get my hands on, and the more I can actually physically plug them into this or that, the more I can learn about how to put together a modest system that takes some advantage of solar. If something I'm using requires more juice than I have power for, it's helpful to me to actually see an error message when I try to run it underpowered. I'm hoping that by slow trial and error, one day I'll understand enough to be able to do something more sophisticated. My next purchase will be a strip of LED lights that takes the add-on adapter type this power supply comes with.",B0B525X4GX,B0B525X4GX,AELARKBAP6VKNL4D22ORELHTREBA,35:38.3,0,FALSE,1513,4.4,5,4
4,"Not a $350 Apple Magic Keyboard, but a very good value!","I’ve got an Apple Magic Keyboard for the 2021 M1 iPad Pro, and I managed to spill coffee on it so it doesn’t work quite as well as it once did. So I got this little bluetooth keyboard/iPad case for use at night in bed. Setup was easy: Press and hold Fn+B until you see “Wireless Keyboard” and then connect. I had no difficulties whatsoever. The iPad holder is an edged pocket with cutouts for the important stuff, just like a phone case. All the cutouts were fine except for the speaker cutouts, which were a little off and covered up some of the speaker holes; for me, this does not appreciably affect the sound. The keyboard magnetically adheres to the case and is removable/repositionable so you can fold the case to create a stand of sorts for the iPad at three different angles. This stand is a little floppy, though, so you need to have it on a hard surface like a laptop tray to keep it stable enough not to collapse; your lap alone won’t do it.<br /><br />The pencil slot below the iPad enclosure is strictly for stowing the Apple pencil or other stylus when you are carrying the closed case. The pencil does stick to the top of the iPad like it normally does, but I don’t get any message that it’s charging off the iPad. The edge of the iPad enclosure is between the iPad and the pencil, so I’m not sure the charging feature from the iPad can “connect.” I don’t use my pencil very frequently, so I did not try to drain it and recharge it off this case. Maybe it works. I just can’t say.<br /><br />I would have given this five stars for its value (under $25!) if the keyboard weren’t a little hard to type on for touch typists. Even banging on the keys hard, some characters still wind up being skipped if you type too fast. It may be the keys will loosen up a little over time, but out of the box they are pretty stiff. The keyboard is also a little bit smaller than the full-sized keyboard I’m used to. It’s close to the Apple Magic Keyboard, however. Another thing Magic Keyboard users might have trouble getting used to is that the keyboard does have to be charged; the magic keyboard does not because it takes its juice directly from the iPad, as the pencil does. Because this case does not magnetically stick to the back of the iPad, it’s not capable of directly charging the separate keyboard. This would be true of any separate keyboard, even one from Apple.",B09MQ2ZKTF,B0C8NGZMSJ,AELARKBAP6VKNL4D22ORELHTREBA,15:08.5,3,FALSE,2375,4.9,4,5
5,Fits my Mac Mini and matching hub perfectly!,"I love my docking station/hub for my M1 Mac Mini, but it’s bad to slide around. Also, for a small-but-mighty computer, the Mac Mini still takes up a good bit of desktop space when all the cables and such are factored in. This vertical stand solves both problems. It matches the finish of my silver Mac Mini and it looks very sleek. The adjustment knobs are well machined, allowing for narrowing the width if you don’t have a hub or widening it if you do. It sits solidly on the desk but can easily be moved around; it does not have to be mounted on anything, and that is a plus for me.",B09CTHJX9T,B09CTHJX9T,AELARKBAP6VKNL4D22ORELHTREBA,46:46.3,1,FALSE,585,4,5,4
5,"I’m burning these in, but they already sound great","I want to point out up front, for those who are afraid these will be too big for a small head, that they fit me fine. I have a small head. I am a short woman, I have little ears, a little head. When these headphones are adjusted to be fully contracted, even without doing any bending of the top part, they fit great. They are lightweight but substantial, very comfortable, and I can see myself listening to them for hours without discomfort. I can lean back in my recliner without anything touching the headphones.<br /><br />I didn’t know about the whole thing about burning in headphones. I’ve spent the last few hours down that rabbit hole, with all the opinions pro and con, etc., and I’m glad I’m doing it because I can already tell the headphones are responding to the burn-in process. I went to Spotify and looked for burn-in playlists, and I’m playing through one of them now.<br /><br />I will not use these for noise cancelling, so I cannot comment on that. I want headphones that don’t bother my ears during hours of listening, that give me a clean, clear experience of the dynamics of the music, and that seem to become a part of me. So far, these are doing that. When I first started listening, I could tell these headphones were a little stiff and muddy, but they are loosening up now and becoming quite wonderful. I’m very pleased. And I’m only a few hours into the burning in.<br /><br />Update: I just tried the ANC button. I’m sitting here, still in burn-in, watching the news on TV and periodically checking in to be sure the burn-in playlist is still playing. I could hear the TV when I was listening to Alice in Chains, and then I turned on the noise cancelling/ANC switch. Hey, this noise cancelling works pretty good! Of course, you get more pressure in your ears with ANC turned on, so it’s not a mode I would listen in for very long, but it definitely cancels the noise. Can’t hear a thing from the TV now. Flip the ANC switch, and I hear the TV. Flip it again, and there’s no voices coming through from the TV.",B09H5MWT89,B09L7YVTZ9,AELARKBAP6VKNL4D22ORELHTREBA,31:23.9,0,FALSE,2036,3.2,5,3
5,"Great for covering soup mugs or mason-jar ferments, too","This is a very nice set of silicone drink coasters that also have other uses around the kitchen. I will use these to loosely cover the top of mason-jar ferments I have going on my counter and also as a cover for soup mugs in the microwave. I work seated in a recliner with angled arms at a lapdesk that also winds up resting at an angle, and one of these coasters allows me to sit my coffee mug right on the lapdesk instead of over on a table because it won't slide. One side of these coasters has an edge of understated etched-in roses; the other side is smooth.

5,Great for business presentations and workshops,"This projector is very simple to set up and use. You'll be tempted to just plug and play, but it's important to read the manual so that you understand how placement and distance affect the quality and size of the projected image.<br /><br />I don't have a lot of experience with projectors, but one thing I've come to understand is that you should choose the lumens based on your planned use of the projector. This projector is perfect for professional presentations done in a less-than-dark setting, such as a workshop or training session. Even with the lights up, you can see the projected material very clearly, and the color brightness is truly a knockout. I've had the opportunity to compare this 3000 lumen professional projector with the [[ASIN:B00EU9V3VW Epson V11H562020 PowerLite Home Cinema 2000 1080p 3LCD Projector]], and the latter is far better suited to a home cinema experience. Don't just assume that higher lumens means better. I find the [[ASIN:B00E87E1ME Epson EX6220 WXGA 3LCD Projector, 3000 lumen color, 3000 lumen white (V11H550220)]] really too bright for an evening home viewing experience, even after adjustment.<br /><br />This projector comes with a professional-looking black shoulder-bag-style carrying case that makes it easy to port to sessions, and it is lightweight. You won't have to look like a dufus lugging a heavy projector around, and it has an understated look in its case that doesn't scream ""steal me!"" Ideally, you'd want to use a projector screen, but if you are trying to project onto a flat white or pastel (say, library or hospital or computer lab) wall, it will be fine without a screen.<br /><br />Epson's projectors are consistently rated highly, whether it's the lower-end ones or those that cost thousands of dollars. You really can't go wrong with them. There is no comparison between a projector and a printer, but if this projector is as reliable as the Epson printers I have owned over the years (as I expect it to be), it will represent a very good value.<br /><br />DH is the one who will be putting this projector through its paces over time, as he does workshops for writers learning to use the internet and various cloud-based software to their advantage. If he has anything negative to say about it, I will come back here and post it, but so far he's loving it. Its image is really crisp and readable, and it's truly easy to use.

4,For the golfer on your list,"This golf GPS watch is a great idea. Golfers have enough to lug around without having to carry a hand-held GPS, too, so to have one strapped to your wrist is a great convenience. The watch is a little bulky for a woman's wrist, perhaps, but for a man it's just right.<br /><br />The beauty of this watch is that you don't have to buy anything else. It comes pre-loaded with a huge database of courses worldwide, including about 90% of the courses in the U.S. If you want to check if your favorite courses are included before purchase, you can look them up on the IZZO web site ahead of time so there's no disappointment. As other reviewers have suggested, however, you need to charge it overnight to be sure the battery has enough juice to do the job.<br /><br />This watch can actually replace your regular watch. It has date/time, alarm, and odometer functions that are useful even off the course.

When asked why they even bothered to put HDMI connectors on the system, the reply was (some consumers desired them).<br /><br />Personally, I feel if a system has HDMI connectors present, that is implies they're fully compliant, otherwise their presence is misleading.<br /><br />What this meant was all of my new toy's (50"" Plasma, Blu-ray player, and Xbox 360) could only pass on video (not the higher quality audio signals through the HDMI connectors), and that I'd have to accept a lower quality audio output due to the use of standard audio connectors.<br /><br />Perhaps I'd missed this in CR's review (or it wasn't stated), as I had to purchase additional digital cabling so that I could even hear the audio content of the devices hooked into the Onkyo (added expense/wiring woe's).<br /><br />If I had to do it all over again, I'd purchase the HT-S5100 as a Stereo Receiver, but I wouldn't recommend it as the hub for a Home Entertainment System to interconnect your HDMI devices.<br /><br />Another pearl-of-wisdom, don't rely strictly upon the written advice of a third-party, go out and listen/view the equipment yourself, as that's what I'm wishing I'd have done!",B0016KAU3U,B0016KAU3U,AHG2AM7FVQQ7AYZVTAE3RVKFJFRA,29:52.0,4,TRUE,2664,3.7,3,4

3,"*Updated* Overall Great Quality.  Purchased 5 for work.  After a year, one started peeling in the middle of tablet surface.","*UPDATED*<br />After a year of use.  The tablet canvas started chipping in the middle of the protective coating.  Stylus pressure and positioning still work but it's annoying as heck plus not it's even chipping more every time I go over same spot. I've never had that happen with any of the Huion & Wacom tablets I've owned for more years than this.  I also can't seem to find a tablet protector for this either.  So kind of bummed because I really like this...or want to really like this tablet.<br /><br />*Original review*<br />First off, just like Wacoms these Huions are compatible with literally all major art software programs as well as budget programs.<br />I personally have used this Huion with Photoshop,  Illustrator, 3D Studio Max, Zbrush, Mudbox, 3D Coat, Substance Painter, Clip Art Studio (Manga Studio), Krita, Painter, Paint Too Sai....can't remember the rest.<br />This NEW  HUION 1060 PLUS is ASIN# B01FTE9HS2 and it comes with a stylus holder, 4 stylus nibs, a carrying case and drawing glove.<br />There is also another NEW version I saw on Amazon which includes 10 stylus nibs, holder and a glove without carrying case but they are the same exact tablet.  They are both the same price on Amazon as of this writing.<br />Not to get you confused but there is an older one also called the 1060 Plus but it is not labled NEW or UPGRADED.<br />It is different cosmetically and has older technology and features.<br />The NEW 1060 Plus has Full-Area Surface Cover and Thinner Border, which makes the drawing surface bigger plus an attached side holder for stylus.  Also, Quieter Express Keys, Better Linearity in art programs, Better pen pressure sensitivity.<br /> (Specifications: Resolution: 5080 LPI, Report Rate: 233 RPS, 2048 Levels of Pressure, 10&#34; x 6.25&#34; active area.)<br />*Note: I just found out they released an even newer one with smoother pressure/linearity and has 8192 levels of pressure but it costs a little bit more.*<br /><br />Now to the good stuff.  Drivers were easy to install and worked right away; which is surprising because I've had driver issues with every non-Wacom tablets in the past.  Actually, there are rare hiccups where the USB wouldn't recognize the tablet so I just have to replug back in.  I've even had that issue with wacoms so I would just have to reconnect the USB back in to get it to recognize.  Another common issue with older tablets (even Wacom) is that with Photoshop sometimes doesn't register the pressure sensitivity so I would have to either restart Photoshop or reconnect the USB.<br />But other than the super rare hiccups, this tablet looks very professional and is an great upgrade from the Huion H610 Pro, which I own, plus the Huion GT 220 graphics tablet which similar to the Wacom 22HD  but way better IPS picture quality.  I  own the Wacom 22HD Touch and is totally not worth the $2000 I spent compared to the $700 I bought the Huion GT220 for.  The Huion GT220 may have not come with express keys but I never use those awkward positioned keys anyways.  I prefer the keyboard or game pad.  I also owned a Wacom Intuos 2, Wacom Intuos 4 and an Intuos 4 Wireless which I've used throughout my professional career as an artist.  (I wanted to compare them to see if a lower cost alternative is worth the savings).  But my recommendation is if you are already an artist or aspiring to be an artist,  don't hesitate on getting the tablet that gives you the best bang for your buck.  Wacom does have good build but drivers can be flakey too.  I've had some Wacoms stop recognizing the drivers to the point where I have to reinstall it.<br />With the 1060 PLUS you're pretty much set with a drawing tablet if you can't afford a Wacom or Surface Pro for all your 3D, drawing and painting needs.  And to me, the pressure curve and sensitivity is feels equal to,  if not better than, the Wacom tablets.<br /><br />This Huion is the best bang for you buck for aspiring artist that want a professional tablet at the best price.  I don't want to stray anyone away from a Wacom if they can afford it. But it's great to know that you can now save 1/5 the cost of a Wacom with the similar, if not better, specifications.<br />Actually, I purchased 5 of these for us artists at work and also had to recently recommend this Huion to my friends and family looking for a tablet for their kids that are also aspiring artist and animators. They showed me their kids' drawings and animation with the mouse I convinced their parents to get a drawing tablet. It is a must have for artists but you don't need to spend an arm and a leg. I truly believe this is the best $80 price range tablet on the market today that runs on Windows 10 (as of this writing).  It has worked well for me for my professional (and personal)  work with 3D sculpting, drawing and painting.  Sorry Wacom....$250 to $300 for a comparable mid-size tablet is not aspiring artist friendly.  They may look a bit cooler but they all achieve the same end.  They also have Wacom Bamboos or budget Wacoms under $70 but they all lack the pressure sensitivity and features with only 1024 levels of sensitivity.  I'm not a Huion salesman but this just makes sense and achieves the same end.....which is quality art without frustrating hardware and features.",B01FTE9HS2,B01FTE9HS2,AHCGJDBR7D35YCM6XTKE3O42NQLQ,21:37.0,147,TRUE,5283,3.9,3,4
4,"Inexpensive than other protectors and GREAT for other 21.5"" drawing tablets too...just have to cut it.","First off, I don't have a Mac monitor so it didn't fit exactly.<br />Bought this because it was cheaper than any of the 21.5&quot; screen protectors out there.  The one for my 21.5&quot; Huion GT220 drawing tablet was ridiculously priced at about $40.  The one for the Wacom Cintiq 22&quot; was about $30 from POSRUS.<br />All I had to to was cut it to size with an office trimming board to keep the lines straight.  It looks clean and somewhat glossy but not too reflective.<br />The only issue I had, as with any big sticky screen protector, is patiently getting out the bubbles.  It's much more time consuming that a smart phone and smaller tablet.  My advice is to try to get it right the first time so you don't have to keep peeling and replacing.  This will help avoid most bubbles and dust particles.

3,"Good antenna, but with some caveats","I purchased the 50 mile with amplifier. Like many other reviewers I've found that the antenna works better without the amplifier. So, I will be returning this for the 35 mile antenna and saving some money. I stay less than 20 miles away from most stations in my area, and only purchased the 50 mile model for the amplifier.  Additionally, I replaced the included cable with RG-6, which increased the signal strength and quality almost as much as the amplifier did, but without the electronic interference. With this modification, and by placing the antenna on the floor I am getting all of the major stations without pixelation. For reference, I am using this antenna with a Channel Master DVR+ connected to a Sony Bravia TV. I hope this helps anyone having issues with this antenna.",B00X4RAEZC,B00X4RAEZC,AEE53XLTNQUIXH75X5T6A24JUQ7A,04:45.0,3,TRUE,783,4.8,3,5

5,Colorado tripod outstanding products,A super good product. I have three of these now. They have just been completely outstanding performance. I shoot on a mirrorless and a micro 4/3 I guess they're both mirrorless the cameras. Lol. But being machine from one piece versus other tripod heads that I've used that are used in a cast. I have one on my ultralight travel tripod and I also have one of my full-size tripod. And I have one on my GorillaPod 5K. I was thinking about picking another one up for my slider. I use a three-legged quick release plate on all of them though. The three-legged quick release is a little bit more expensive than what this is each one of these. So with the three-legged quick release plate and this it's about Just under a hundred bucks for each ball head that I have. But I also use peak design capture clip and it fits perfect. The ball head is dynamite along with the three-legged quick release plate even before I use the quick release plate the plate is dynamite very smooth everything works perfect.

5,Best ND filter in my opinion,I bought this 15 stop square ND filter. The construction and the quality is top-notch. I bought it for my ultrawide lens. A 10 stop ND filter just does not do good.

Virtually no color cast. I would have to compared to Lee filters. I was looking for an alternative to lee. I have tried other brands. do not buy the cheaper ND filters. It's a waste of your money.<br /><br />I've shot in the rain with this nano pro. The water just beads right off. Fingerprints just wipe off. I take extremely good care of my ND filters but I have not had any problems with smudges or scratches. The case of comes in it's a nice aluminum protective case with padding inside.

5,PERFECT entry level gaming TV,"The picture quality is phenomenal. I got this because it was the cheapest 2022 Samsung model I could find that could run the XBOX app (cloud gamining without using a physical xbox).<br />A hardcore gamer who plays competeitve first person shooters might want to go for a higher model...like the Q80B, because that has VRR and 120Hz). But for people who are just playing Final Fantasy, Assassin's Creed, and Minecraft this is just fine, because the difference are minimal to non competitive gamers. It would costs hundreds more for a smaller size of the higher level models.<br />The sound quality is good and I don't feel inclinded to get a soundbar. It's lightweight and thin, so I was able to set it up myself as a petite woman. It was easy to navigate the menus and setup everything. It auto detected all gaming devices I plugged into the HDMI ports and added the icons to the gaming center section. Customer service responds within seconds on the samsung site for any questions. My only complaint was the annoying bloatware Samsung TV app that auoplayed random TV episdodes everytime I turned the TV on. Easy fix, long press on it and select ""disable"". Oh, and the remote charges by solar energy (either your ceiling lights or sunlight!). I found the viewing experience so pleasant, that I re-watched some movies I already saw in the past, just to see them in upgraded graphics.<br />Zero regrets for this purchase.

They're not audiophile speakers, of course, but they sound much better than some of the other outdoor speakers I've heard, and better than any other outdoor speaker I auditioned in this price range.<br />-They're rugged, which you really need in an outdoor speaker.  It's not just rain, after all; an outdoor speaker has to contend with errant footballs, rough handling, curious animals, etc, any of which would break a normal indoor speaker.  These have a metal grill and very sturdy build and should stand up to almost anything.<br />-I like the mounting system; very flexible and well-engineered.<br /><br />The Bad (and these are minor)<br />-Very cramped, awkward space for the binding posts.  I use banana plugs because I need a quick, easy way to hook them up (standing on a ladder, fumbling around behind the speaker) and there's not enough room back there for normal banana plugs.  I wound up buying some right-angle plugs (I got the Monoprice), and those resolved this for me.<br />-Sound quality is good for an outdoor speaker in this price range but if you don't need a rugged speaker, you can get much better sound for the price.  As I'm writing this review, the ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2 is on sale for about the same price as these Atriums, and the ELAC has much better sound.  Of course, the ELAC probably wouldn't survive a night on my patio.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you need an outdoor speaker in this price range, this speaker would be my recommendation.",B00378KMG4,B0BKRL9CFW,AFC6IECK7PRZCQ5G7EGVQGHAXYIQ,54:23.9,2,TRUE,1505,4.6,4,5

5,Love it and recommend it...see why,"I really do like this case!<br /><br />PROs: Many, however, just a couple for special note. I do use the strap for carrying and also when I'm sitting back in my chair, and balance my tablet on my tummy where the kickstand may not work to my liking. Also, this product comes with a front piece with and without the screen protector so you can choose to use the screen protector or not.<br /><br />CON-ish: Just hear me out, because I do recommend this case... The speaker openings muffles the sound from my speakers in a way that they sound like I'm listening through a tube or can. But here's the thing, the speakers on my tablet are NOT that great either. So in the longrun, I would not say that this case is  useless at all. In fact, I use my bluetooth Anker headsets anyways, and I get much, MUCH better sound quality.  Also, it is a little difficult pulling the windows down because the case is so thick and close to the edge of the screen. However, once again, not a deal breaker, just a learning curve to learn how to work it.<br /><br />I got the lime green color because, quite frankly, that's my favorite color in the world!<br /><br />I hope my review helps you decide to purchase.

Given the price of this thing, I’m surprised. Very poor quality materials.<br /><br />The earphones work great while the phone also charges. However, there is a big negative in that if the phone wiggles, the phone makes bing noises, like that bing it makes when the charger is first attached. This is a drag at night because others hear it. On the previous iPhones, 4 and 5S, if the headphone was in the headphone jack, any sound from attaching the charger was silenced. With this adapter, it’s not silenced.

5,Very pleased so far,"I got this case last week. It looks fantastic, adds very little weight (which is very important to me) or bulk to the device, does not obstruct the screen in any way, and works perfectly with the sleep/wake function. Openings and spaces for headphones, camera, volume control, etcetera, line up perfectly. I like that the magnets in the case keep the cover stuck to the back of the iPad when I fold it open like a magazine cover.<br /><br />I know that some people like having a hole in the back of their case to display the Apple logo in the center of the iPad's chassis, but I don't. (I see that hole as an unnecessary weakness in the ability of the case to protect my iPad.) So I am pleased this case doesn't have that hole. It has been very difficult to find a lightweight, sufficiently protective cover for my iPad (3), but I am very, very satisfied with this case so far. Minimalist, yet chic and professional-looking. I love this bronze color; it's almost like an understated gold tone, complete with a slightly metallic sheen. It seems like the Joy Factory got it right. In my opinion, this is almost the perfect case.<br /><br />(I had a Photive ultra slim folio on my iPad before. It is also lightweight, but not as light as this. Also, the rubber rim around the face of the iPad kept peeling off in long strips, and sometimes my iPad would slide out of it for no good reason. I got the blue version of the Photive case; it doesn't look very professional in the first place; it looks like semi-faded blue jeans, to be honest, which is not what I was expecting. And when the rubber edge started to peel, it just looked tackier and tackier. It had a stylus holder, but it was such a struggle to try to get my stylus into the elastic that I gave up. It also had a hole in the back to display the logo. I'm so glad I found this Joy Factory case! One thing I will say in favor of the Photive case: it allowed me to prop the iPad up on my lap fairly easily, something which isn't so easy with the Joy Factory case. That factor is not anywhere near being a deal-breaker, though.)",B007M4ZKSO,B00BL17DQ6,AFY5BD36VD6QUPSPVUZJHUFO7TAA,34:40.0,0,TRUE,2082,5,5,5

4,"My second Surface Book, first one (Surfacebook 1) had expanding battery failure","I initially purchased a Surface Book over competitors because of the great screen definition, as I am an amateur photographer, and screen definition was important to me. I also use it daily for work as a software trainer, which requires a Windows computer (I was and still am an Apple fan).. At 4 years the screen began to have a yellow mark at the sides, and after research I learned about a problem with these computers, which is an expanding battery. Now the screen is bulging and it is unsafe, Microsoft will replace it up to 3 years, but will do nothing for me, other than a $600 “repair” which I may do, to have it as a backup. When stores were open, rumor has it that managers were doing this for free, but they are permanently closed now.  I use this laptop for work, and if It is out of commission, I am out of work.<br />With a failing computer,, why did I buy another? I still love the screen, size factor is good (I travel with it regularly), and the keyboard is comfortable, but the white backlit key color blends into the keys, so they are hard to see, one of my few complaints. I have been through multiple chargers, the Microsoft OEM chargers have died after a short period, developing a short at the connection to the computer. The new model seems to have a thicker wire, so I am hoping that it lasts longer, but the third party chargers I finally learned to buy work great anyway, and I have backups if I need them. I found this at a fairly good price, so there you go. This was an upgrade to an I7 chip, my first is an I5, for the use I give it I haven’t seen much difference.<br /><br />One tip, I just went from a 3.5mm connector headset to a USB headset. With the former, I had to use an amplifier, and ultimately the computer stopped recognizing the microphone.

4,Sound and battery life are great!!,"When I first got these, I had a problem with the left earpiece not having sound, and the sound that came from the right ear was very tinny. Customer service was absolutely wonderful to resolve this for me very quickly. Since then, the sound is great! I have really small ears and I do find them a bit too big, even with the smallest cover, which keeps me from wearing them as long as I'd like. I haven't actually tried them in wet conditions, so I can't speak to this, but they are very well made and seem like they will last a long time.<br />--Pros<br />*Even though I was worried about the earpieces not being switchable, because I am left eared, this has worked alright when I am driving. I just hang the left earpiece on my shirt and use it with my right hand to work the controls.<br />*Charging is very fast.<br />*A charge last quite a long time, especially if you only use them for calls. Even listening to music it last a long time.<br />*The sound is nice and loud with lots of bass for listening to music.<br />*Call sound quality is great, for me, and for the listening party.<br />*The are easy to keep up with, using the nice case that they came with. It slips right into my purse or other bag.<br />*Well made. Durable and made with quality materials.<br />---Cons<br />*The earpieces are too large for my ears, even with the smallest cover, and my ears start to hurt after a short time.<br />*The pieces that go around your ears is shaped in a way that the bottom pushes into the back of my ear, causing it to get very sore.<br />*They are a bit larger and heavier than I'd like them to be.<br />*It would be nice to have a small clip for when you are driving, so that you can clip it to your shirt, to be hands free.<br /><br />Overall, these are great headphones. They need a little tweaking, especially on the earpieces to make them more comfortable on the ears, but I would still highly recommend them.",B07JP7ZGFQ,B07JP7ZGFQ,AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,31:44.7,2,FALSE,1923,4.9,4,5

5,REALLY IMPRESSED,"I've gone threw a few Google home Mini cases: stand, clock holder style shape and a cat type cover. But they made the Mini look more like a toy from an aesthetic perspective.<br /><br />This one however, for me is perfect. Minimalist, easy to assemble and a 2ndary option to extend the cord longer and plug a 2nd magnet to a wall (elevating) the Mini further up the wall. (which is why I left more cord exposed)<br /><br />Simple to assemble. I would start with putting the mini in the rubber case first alone, than follow the directions. (The image that shows the Mini and my hand). When following the instructions: step 1, is basically flipping the rubber over to match image 2 in the set up booklet. Than its all downhill from there.<br /><br />You can leave very little cord exposed or expose some if you want to extend the Mini further up the wall to use the spare wall magnet. I left cord more visible in mine because i'm setting it on the wall on the top outlet. Also, you have to center the mini holder to the magnet, it has a spot where the weight doesnt make it fall out. Make sure when rolling the cord is rolled in lines, and not one section when following directions. (To move the weight evenly). Take into consideration, the outlet has to be flat. (if it pops out from the sides) it may slide off. Mine were not fully flat, but stayed in. In our 2nd room, we have a full flat face outlet and its perfect.",B07F3Z9R4T,B07F3Z9R4T,AEGC2QAVYZGT4HMW5UETR5KXONCA,14:54.3,2,TRUE,1418,5,5,5
5,Former plasma user and blown away by this LED,"Random personal info:<br /><br />My past flatscreens for the last 12 years have been plasmas 50-60 inches, so making the LED jump was a little bit nerve racking since I wanted the best picture and best blacks. (LED tend to lack pure blacks which tends to affect the overall picture). After 2 months of researching and looking around, I decided to pull the trigger on this model. I can actually say im happy with it. My original experience with LCD/LED made me dislike them mostly for the ""grey blacks"" or clouding type of effect it gave off on dark scenes.  This LED is phenomenal!  obviously tech has improved.. I am truly happy with it and can say its was worth the purchase. At the end of the review I will add miscellaneous features. (be prepared to read)<br /><br />Why I choose 1080p instead of 4k? To put it simple, not enough support. In a few years 4k TVs will be lower in price and better supported. Also 4k streaming quality is still new and compressed, not true 4k. Makes no logical sense in getting 4k TV right now. Save the money and go for a bigger TV with full support. 4k is 3840 x 2160 resolution, but adding sources not in 4k like 1920 x 1080 will make the TV upscale the image to make it viewable, but it does not magically make the content 4k quality.<br /><br />Primary use:<br /><br />Blu Rays, Playstation 4 and streaming from Hulu+. (occasional screen mirroring from Android phone). Bi weekly movie watcher and buyer. Love Blu Ray films. Audiophile, so I need a matching quality screen. Everything I use is HD and very rarely SD quality programing so I cannot comment on SD picture quality performance..<br /><br />OUT OF THE BOX:<br /><br />First thing I did was connect the TV to the internet and  download any software update before calibrating.The people having issues connecting to the internet, just restart the modem. I had similar issues, but after restarting the cable mode (if using cable) fixed my connection problem. It's the same as when you add a new wireless router, you always have to restart the modem and router. The TV would not connect to the internet even when I used a wired connection. UNTIL I restarted the cable modem -Then instantly connected.<br /><br />At boot up, the picture settings were basic running on factory default options and having light sensor which fluctuated the colors and brightness since it adjusted based off room lighting.My main room is dark in bright days, but the left side of the room has a door with a mini window that lets light in. (Incase I have all blinds closed) I opened all my blinds letting light in from every angle (right and left walls have a wide window  the size of the walls) So its massive amount of outdoor light and the TV performed well. Something LEDS are know for.<br /><br />Calibration:<br /><br />After switching picture modes. I disabled the light sensor that adjust the TVs brightness automatically and any power save modes that affect picture. (This is where some of the Amazon reviews are saying it's dark or cloudy out of the box.) You are trying to calibrate something that keeps shifting based on the light in the room. Shut them off before calibrating. Honestly, some of these modes are not needed since the TV is not going anywhere and you have control of how much light comes in. It has a tendency to make the image darker and faded the less light there is.. Lets be honest here, you're buying a 70 inch screen, you want the image clear, bright, sharp and detailed. Not cloudy or constantly shifting. After disabling it, it instantly improved every other out of the box picture calibration.<br /><br />PICTURE OPTIONS:<br /><br />AUTO MODE: (Adjust itself based on light in the room), STANDARD: (ENERGY STAR) , USER: Create your own picture preference. DYNAMIC FIXED: Not user adjustable.<br /><br />MOVIE: (Sharps take on how a film should look like in low light)<br /><br />VINTAGE FILM: film effect, never used it and have no desire to tint an HD image into a vintage film..You can also add a flickering effect.<br /><br />GAME STANDARD: (optimized for games) but for me, made the image darker since they lower or turn off some of the picture calibrations. I have never been a fan of game mode on any set i've bought in the last 12 years strictly because it makes games not as colorful and dull looking. You can calibrate, but in my opinion game mode disables a lot of the features. Turning things on and off would defeat the purpose of Game Mode.<br /><br />DYNAMIC: As the name implies, picture is bright and colorful. This mode can be adjusted by the users so not everything is maxed out. I think they calibrated dynamic mode well. If overly bright, you can lower or raise anything to your preference while still using the dynamic features. People tend to say is ""show room bright"". This LED version was calibrated well. This is my personal favorite since I can adjust things to optimize the TV.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />Exceptional picture, dark blacks that are inky pen black, which is a positive by the way. High level of detail, screen panel is nice. White color does not overpower grey fonts or bleed into blacks. Reds, golds and all colors look natural and vivid. Reflection is very minimal to almost invisible. Due to the size, you do see a partial reflection when off, but the panel is almost like a PC monitor you sorta see a reflection with very little light. Nothing overly like a mirror. The screen looks organic like a dark skinned mirror minus the high level reflection.<br /><br />WIFI  (802.11 a/b/g/n) 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz<br /><br />Wallpaper Mode: Plays 16x9 images on a USB stick and let them play in the background. The TV simulates museum lighting or you can use the built in ones from Winter, Spring, Autumn and summer images. You can even use a clock feature built in. Can be turned on or off and turns on when the TV is in standby mode or used when the set is turned on in shuffle mode. USB stick and create folder named WP and add images for it to be seen when off.<br /><br />4 HDMIs 1.4. HDMI 1 being ARC compatible (Audio return channel). HDMI 2 is MHL compatible for smartphone or Google Chrome cast sticks which can power the unit cordless. Miracast and it can read a PC in the same network. Photo viewer,  movie viewer and music player. Built in instruction manual at the press of a button. DLNA capable and screen share input for your phone. Autostart with a HDMI capable device (PS4) and will switch to HDMI device. Can also set the TV to power down by itself or when no signal is detected.<br /><br />2 USB (side and bottom)<br /><br />8 million to 1 contrast ratio.<br /><br />Vesa compliant 400x400 this LED uses 4 , 6 mm machine screw. I bought them for about $5 before the TV arrive since they are not included.<br /><br />Setting to switch your speakers (built into the TV) to wall mount mode or stand mode. Has multiple picture modes found in every set. Widescreen, 4.3, zoom, stretch, dot by dot 1080p mode replication, DNR - Digital noise reduction and various sound modes with clear voice.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Netflix button is slightly annoying. I have medium size hands and tall fingers and the Netflix button is under the menu down arrow which make me trigger the Netflix app since fingers touch the button due to the closeness. It's a wide button, just like the down arrow above it. So naturally you may trigger it since they feel the same way. Bad button placement that takes time getting use to it. That is my only annoyance or negative.<br /><br />Personal opinion after 5 days of use.<br /><br />I love this flat screen!<br /><br />Our seating area, if you're looking at a clock is from a 3 o'clock angle to 9 o'clock (a half circle when viewing a clock).It only distorted at an 11 o'clock angle and we are 10 feet away from the TV. No one watches TV at that angle so its not an issue. LED/LCD are know to not provide good viewing angles the farther you sit to the side. But you really need to be an a crazy angle like 1 o'clock or 11 for it to distort. I have never seen a person sit at such a sharp angle for it to become an issue. You will never find an LED/LCD that does not distort, so its not a negative since all TVs have them minus plasmas and they are no longer making them anymore. I have not had any of the issues some of the reviewers were or are having. I CANNOT LIST ""VIEWING ANGLES"" OR ""BASIC SPEAKERS"" AS A NEGATIVE. Its common in all flat screens to have very basic sound due to it's design.<br /><br />I have absolutely no regrets in buying it. I truly can say it's money well spent. Everything looks newer that I want to replay old games and rewatch my bluray collection. Blacks are ULTRA DARK and almost no reflection. When I turned my two 100 watts bulbs on in my ceiling fan, it was still watchable, but preferred to shut them off since they do semi appear on dark film parts. (Old plasma had the same issue so its not LED related) In bright areas they don't reflect or almost no reflection in day scenes or bright parts in a film. Dynamic (adjustable mode not fixed) is my personal favorite. It's not overly bright and can be adjusted. The Whites DO NOT blend in with writing text when I play a game that requires me to read. My older plasmas dynamic mode was overly bright that white were to white and bleed into fonts on games making them invisible. Surprisingly, greys stood out perfectly while using dynamic. Something most tvs have issues with.<br /><br />Darks are INKY black and just what I wanted from an LED. Bright picture and Inky blacks. If you're afraid darks will not be dark but grey/black or you're switching over from a plasma. You will not be disappointed. I am truly happy with this LED. Films are smooth and solid looking and almost surreal. Everything looks REAL and when cars are flipping, dirt and items breaking apart like Optimus prime transforming you see every single object move. I need to replay some of my older games and films because everything feels like a NEW EXPERIENCE. Watched 30 minutes of transformers and was taken back by how everything is surreal looking. In the film Gravity, every object hovering in the air floating looked like it was in real time live. You even saw dust particles shining about in the air. The detail level of this LED is phenomenal. I am seeing things that never stood out before like water on cars dripping of the glass revealing dry areas. (I've seen them before, but now they instantly stand out) this is also due to the 70 inch screen and I did own a 60. Going from a 60 inch to 70 was very noticeable jump in size. Even a friend said WOW! MASSIVE TV! (in a postive way). Some reviewers are saying its a black screen hanging on the wall as a negative. This is sorta expected, since you are buying a 70 inch LED NOT a 30 inch clear glass screen.<br /><br />I know this review has a lot more positives, but I went in extremely picky and came back happy.<br /><br />EDIT: 1/09/2015<br /><br />Disabling 120hz and film mode for gaming improves response time and kills the ""soap opera effect"". (It does) and re-starting it for blu rays (if it doesn't bother you). For example, I can use dynamic or any other mode without using game mode and disable 120hz/film mode and instantly see an improvement with online games regarding response time. Doing this will also remove any tv enhancements that people may not like the ""soap opera effect"". I actually don't mind it for some blu rays but online games have a slight lag to them when enabled.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Dynamic mode. Use Dynamic mode fixed (not adjustable) for blu rays and single player games that has everything enabled. Than switch to Dynamic mode (adjustable) then disabled the enhancements. That way you have two Dynamic modes, one with the enhancements on, and another with them disbaled. This allows you to switch with a button press between FIXED and Dynamic (adjustable) without having to turn them on and off constantly.",B00HZZZM56,B00HZZZM56,AEGC2QAVYZGT4HMW5UETR5KXONCA,07:17.0,68,TRUE,11956,4.4,5,4

5,Buy this one!,"I have gone through at least a hundred charging cables. Either the cord frays or the magnetic cables screw up the phone.

Well, of course mine did break, and their ""guaranty"" is useless. Decided to try this one.  Buy it. Everything about it is PERFECT.  It kind of snaps into the phone for a snug fit. It has extra protection at the terminal end near the phone, so no more frayed cords. It is offset mounted so fraying is much less likely and more comfortable to use.  It comes in a variety of nice colors so you don't have to unscramble five cords to find it.  It is inexpensive.  You get two of them. It has the fastest charge I've ever had.

5,Little laptop that packs a lot!,"It only seems appropriate that I am writing this review on the laptop.  I really love this thing.  I purchased myself a very expensive laptop just a few years ago.  It is big, and it was supposed to have the 360 hinge, but when it arrived it did not.  I almost returned it then but didn't want to go through the hassle.  It's a great laptop, but it is big and heavy (comparatively), which is perfect when I have to buckle down and focus on work.  But when I need something on the go or just want to do something while chilling, it is too much.<br />So when I saw this I was super excited.  It loads up super fast, actually recognizes my fingerprint (most things won't) and has a good battery life.  Touch screen is nice and sensitive.  I will mostly be using it for basic internet, streaming movies, and maybe a little gaming.  The graphic quality is great as is the sound for the size.  And the 360 is a MUST if you have cats (hello being able to stream a movie without the cats walking over the keyboard and turning it off!!).<br />I haven't tried any video editing on it yet, but I will be soon and am hopeful it will be up to the task.  I think the only thing I'd really like would be one more USB port, but I'll just have to dig out my hub when I get to that point.<br />Bonus, it came with a bunch of stickers you can decorate it with. Not my thing personally, but a super cute idea.",B09T5QWMD8,B0CB4R468X,AEWEFMYIW56SZHW7R22ARFBRSKYA,52:09.1,2,FALSE,1389,5,5,5

5,Finally - They stay on my ears and sound good,"I have had way too many sets of headphones.  Mostly because my dog eats them if they are within reach.  While I still have not found the perfect headset with these, they come pretty close.<br /><br />Durability and battery Life - Way too early to tell.  I'll update this after a few months.<br /><br />Noise Canceling- Let’s get something straight - if you put your fingers in your ears, they will cancel noise. That's called passive noise canceling, or simply, blocking outside noise.  True active noise canceling head phones are over the ear, and usually very expensive.  These head phones do a pretty good job passively blocking outside noise by fitting very well to the ear and being angled correctly.<br /><br />Sound - Everyone has different tastes when it comes to what they like to hear.  Some headphones have good or bad ranges from high to low.  But it is the quality of the range that matters.  For instance, I like to hear bass, and to me there is nothing worse than a tinny am radio sound.  These definitely have bass, but it's a bit muddy.  The good news is I was able to adjust the equalizer on my phone to clean it up, mostly.  Overall all though, for the price, the sound quality is pretty darn good.<br /><br />Fit & Hold - They Fit and stay put!  The best part of these headphones is they fit my ears perfectly.  The part that goes around the ear has a wire going through it, unlike so many others.  This allows you to mold the over ear wires exactly to you ear and they do not fall out.  None of the last several sets I had do this, and it is an enormous benefit.<br /><br />Controls - The are typical up and down volume and a center button that is used for on, off, hold, answer, etc.  I wish the volume buttons were reversed, but that's just being picky.  They announce power on, power off and connected.  Sadly, they do not announce battery life.<br /><br />Appearance – Meh.  They are a bit big and boxy, but I don’t know how that‘s different from having white things hanging out of your ears for $200.00<br /><br />Overall -  I am giving this 5 starts not because they are the best headphones.  I am giving them 5 starts because they check off almost all of my boxes and the price it great.  So, 5 stars for overall function and price.<br /><br />Note: I paid full price for these and I was not asked to review them. Also, if you like this review, please indicate so below.  Thanks.",B07KR62YBD,B07KR62YBD,AG6DP7SLJDN5VEGUJI6M6GADZI3A,04:10.6,334,TRUE,2407,4.4,5,4
3,"Keyboard works great, Not so good as a cover","I tried one of the less expensive cover/keyboard and returned it for several reasons.  I kept this one, but just barely.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />The cover is very well built and looks like it will last a while.  The keyboard works great and the Android specific keys are a major plus.  The App that you can optionally install seems to work very well also.  The keyboard is well laid out and the keys give good feedback when typing. Connectivity was a snap and battery life seems more than acceptable to me.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />This thing will exactly double the weight of your device.  You don't realize what a difference that makes until you put them together.  You go from 1 to 2 pounds.<br /><br />This part is not Logitech's fault, but the Galaxy Tab 3 has the charging port on the bottom but should be coming out of the side.  If you add this Samsung design defect to this cover, it means you can not charge and use the device at the same time when propped up on the stand.  That is completely ridiculous!<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />You can not charge the device with the cover closed (tablet protected) because Logitech didn't put a hole in the cover. This inexcusable design flaw can be overcome with a steady hand and an X-Acto knife.  I created a square hole in the cover to accommodate the charger.  It takes a lot of lining up, but mine came out perfectly.<br /><br />When using certain charging cables, the plastic the tablet snaps into stops the cable from going into the tablet all the way.  This second design flaw from Logitech can be corrected with a steady had and a dremmel tool to remove some of the plastic that sticks out over the charging port.<br /><br />On the other end of the cover/keyboard the plastic that holds the tablet in covers half of the IR emitter.  So if you want to use your device as a TV remote, it has to be held just right.<br /><br />The worst part of this device is that if you flip the cover/keyboard open 180 degrees, half the time you can't type on the on screen keyboard because the cover/keyboard magnets make the device thinks its closed. Or worse, you unlock it and the two halves touch and it locks and turns off the tablet again. (Yes I know this feature can be turned off on the tablet)<br /><br />Overall:<br />I kept the device because it is well made (but not well thought out), I was able to customize it to overcome design flaws, and after I customized it I couldn't return it. Half the problems above wouldn't be an issue of Samsung put the charging port on the side.  But I have to assume if Logitech sells a cover/keyboard for this specific device, that should have at least tried it first.  But in the end propped up and used in conjunction with a BT mouse, its like having a very portable / convertible laptop. And that was my goal.",B00F1CRTJM,B00F1CRTJM,AG6DP7SLJDN5VEGUJI6M6GADZI3A,58:06.0,12,TRUE,2821,1.9,3,2

5,Happy with my new TomTom,"I just wanted to provide this small tip to new users of the TomTom. It's about the suction cup for the windshield - I've read review that it doesn't hold well, and one person said that if he wet the cup before sticking, that worked for a while. The windshield mount that comes with the TomTom actually is designed to hold - but the instructions aren't clear. So here's how you get it to hold really tight - you couldn't even pull it off.<br /><br />You will need to figure out the position of the mount first, then separate it from your TomTom, since you can't do the rest of this with it attached. With the suction cup facing the windshield (away from you), turn the disk that is in the center all the way counter clockwise. Then stick the mount onto your windshield where you want it, and while you push it with your hand, use your other hand to turn the disk in the center all the way clockwise. That motion, turning it clockwise, makes the suction cup really tight. Then you can put your TomTom back onto the mount.<br /><br />Hope this helps some folks. My mount fell off a couple of times, then I realized what I'd done wrong.<br /><br />When I went to the web site to set up the My Tomtom account and check for updates, I have to say that it wasn't super intuitive - at first it wouldn't take my code. Not sure why that is, but after going through some stuff I was able to do it. The GPS itself is very nice, I like the choices of voices, and the display is nice.

5,IP functionality can be simple or as complicated as you want it to be.,"Fantastic camera.  One of those items that screamed quality right out of the box.  Good build, compact size, and has a waterproof connector for your Ethernet cable.  Can be mounted where the cable comes through a hole in a fascia board behind the camera or where the cable comes out the side of the base.  Base is infinitely adjustable.  Camera has slight overhang on the top to keep water off the lens.  Three pigtail cables - RJ-45 female connector can be the single cable if you have PoE or you can power this via a 12v power adapter or cable (local or centralized) for versatility.<br /><br />This is my first IP camera, but I've used many analog cameras and DVRs.<br /><br />I've hooked this up three ways:  By itself, to a switch on the same network as a stand-alone NVR, and to a switch on the same network utilizing my QNAP NAS as the NVR - in each case powered by PoE.  Here are some details I've figured out in the process:<br /><br />---By itself:  You can view it quickly and easily without delay with the App, which seems to have all the things you'd expect from a camera viewing app.  I assume you can record to or snapshot to an SD card from the description, but I'm going to record to my network, so I didn't try that feature.  This was just plug and play, worked super easy.<br /><br />What I love is that once you figure out the IP address, you can access the camera via a webserver, which pretty much future-proofs the hardware.  I despise ""smart"" devices where you need an app, because then you're at their mercy to run their app on whatever OS they decide to use and they can force you to make accounts, update, etc.  Having this open to the user/owner is the way to go.  Bravo.<br /><br />And that web server is full featured.  I was able to play around and do everything here before I bothered downloading the app.<br /><br />Note that - like every camera I've ever used - the viewing software sends a substream which is lower resolution unless you demand the higher resolution.  With the app you can see low and medium resolution, but 4k has trouble playing over WiFi (or else it's just smart enough to realize my screen can't support it anyway).  Just pointing this out so you realize if you're seeing pixels, that doesn't mean the camera isn't actually recording at 4k.<br /><br />---With NVR:  I recently acquired a cheap 8-channel 4k NVR that I believe to be a Uniview OEM.  I added a hard drive and put it on the same network as this camera.  The NVR has an 8 port PoE switch built in, but it must also be a router, because it wants to use a different subnet if you put the camera on the NVR's switch.  Otherwise, you can easily point the NVR to the camera via IP address.<br /><br />So...if you point the NVR to the camera via IP address, you can view the camera from its own app or from the NVR app.  I assume this still takes one of the NVRs 8 channels.  This might be useful if you want to give someone access to just one camera on your network.  But it occurred to me that, setup this way, you have constant data streaming over your network, and after you add quite a few cameras in 4k, this is going to start adding up.<br /><br />If you put the camera directly on the NVR, you'll have to change the IP manually to match the subnet, or maybe you'll somehow get it to work through the NVR or with DHCP.  I hadn't bothered spending time figuring this out yet because at the time I thought I'd just use my other switch, but I'm thinking once I get more cameras, it'll probably make more sense to put them directly onto the NVR and ...actually, then I won't have to change my entire IP scheme since I won't have so many new devices to organize.<br /><br />I'm certain I can get it all working in unison with no problem, but it is more complicated than if you just buy an NVR set with a bunch of cameras already ready to work together.  Either way shouldn't be a problem if you have IP knowledge, but I'm guessing a random homeowner might prefer a set.<br /><br />---Using my NAS as NVR.  Hmmm...a little disappointed with QNAP in this regard.  I mean, I have three NASs, and I'm assuming they all have 2 licenses included, but to combine them into one program then I believe requires yet another license.  I'm not into licenses, even if they're a one time deal, because that means you need accounts and if something happens where they're lost, you can run into all kinds of other issues.  I just think consumers need to stand up to this sort of thing.  But anyway, I had two included, so I tried it out:<br /><br />I realized that this is a lot of work for my little consumer grade NAS, and even if I had a more hardcore NAS, I'm not sure I want resources being used all the time.  It seems like I couldn't get it to use H.265 compression, nor could I get it to record at the higher resolutions and frame rates.  Again, I didn't play with this too awful much once I got it recording and working because I already realized I definitely like the stand alone DVR better.  The QNAP even had extra stuff to download and windows to pop up on your PC and all this other stuff.  Just not as streamlined as I had hoped.<br /><br />----Conclusion is that the camera is awesome.  I'm not sure many are any better at this point.  If you want something that just works easy and you don't know much about networking, you may wish to just buy an NVR set.  But if you are IP capable, I think buying components separately could be a great way to go because you can really customize what you want to do.  But as always, more options with networking means more potential headaches.  But I am pretty certain that once you get it working the way you want it, you should be able to forget all about it and have it work indefinitely.<br /><br />Oh, and after all that, I shouldn't forget to point out that I'd be thrilled to have this all by itself watching my porch just so I can tell when there's a package out there.

4,Be prepared to permanently install the adaptor to your phone,"I did not realize this, but in order to use the suction mount with your phone you will need to adhere an adaptor to your phone or phone case.  So, if you want to use this with multiple phones or you get a new phone or case, you are going to need a new adaptor (as of Apr. 2015 priced at $20 on the Lifeproof website).  With claimed industrial strength adhesive, I doubt it would be easy trying to remove the adaptor from a phone or case once installed.  It also says in the instructions “not compatible with silicone, rubber, wood, heavily textured, or rounded surfaces,” so keep the material of your phone or phone case in mind.  Putting the adaptor on your phone might be more palatable if you have any interest in their other products that use the adaptor (belt clip, armband, bike bar mount).<br />With that out of the way, I will say that this is an exceptionally well made product.  It is plastic, but heavy duty.  All the parts move and adjust easily.  The suction mechanism is very strong – it gets suctioned by turning a switch of sorts, which locks it down tightly.  The angle is easily adjusted without fear of losing suction.  Definitely a great product if you want to have your phone mounted while driving.  Mechanism to release phone from the mount works with ease.<br />So, if you are willing to adhere the adaptor to your phone, this is a well-designed, well-made product, and useful product.",B00UIF2H1M,B00UWL4AU8,AGRPLHGW2CR6WWOHT5TOWXDGIZEQ,54:46.0,6,FALSE,1408,3.4,4,3
5,How this fits into the Epson line of projectors,"I also have an Epson EX7220 WXGA projector with 3000/3000 color/white lumens.  Both are excellent projectors that have surprised me by their ease of use and great clarity even in lit rooms.  But the EX7220 costs about 50% more, while the two projectors come in the exact same form factor (i.e., the casing, buttons, and remote are 99.5% identical).  Additionally, there are loads of other Epson projectors in their lineup, all priced differently, so what do you get when you spend more money?<br /><br />1)  Resolution.  I just now realized how important this is.  Although I was surprised just how well both projectors play movies from my computer projected onto a wall (even a light yellow or a light brown wall, without the color of the picture seeming to suffer), I now realize that you should pick a resolution that matches your computer's resolution or your computer's ability to send out the projector's native resolution.<br /><br />For example, my computer's native resolution is WXGA and so is the EX7220's, so I can mirror my monitor's image on the wall (which is what you'll probably do in most situations - especially presentations - so you can see what is happening on your small screen.  The alternative is to &#34;extend&#34; your desktop onto the wall, which in some cases can output a different resolution, but this is not as practical in most cases, particularly presentations) with a perfect match from computer to projector.  However, when I connect the VS330 in XGA resolution (with a 4:3 ratio), it looks good, but there is black, unused space all around the actual image because the resolutions are in different formats.  The black area is basically wasted pixels.  You can put it in 4:3 mode, but you're getting a degraded (although still sharp) image on the wall.<br /><br />Just as monitors have gotten higher in resolution over time, projectors are not far behind.  But you definitely pay for the difference.  For basic work presentations and casual video watching, 1024x768 is fine.  As you want to put more information on one screen or watch high definition movies in your free time, you'll want to look at a higher end monitor.<br /><br />2.  Luminescence.  There is now an official standard to differentiate between color lumens and white lumens, whereas in the past only lumens were specified.  I am fully convinced that color lumens matter, particularly for presentations where visual content matters and especially for video watching.  That said, I am amazed how great movies look projected onto a large, empty wall, and it surprises me that more people don't watch everything via projector.  I'd never buy a projector that didn't specify color lumens.  And, clearly, you pay exponentially for a greater color lumen output.<br /><br />3.  Accessories.  The VS330 lacks the carry bag, wireless connection dongle (although it comes with the bracket that now I have to be sure not to lose in case I'd ever get the dongle), and extra cables that come with the EX7220.  Not a big deal by any standards, although I do like the (very basic) carry bag that comes with the EX7220.<br /><br />To speak specifically to this projector, I am really impressed how easy it is to set up and get working correctly.  It's basically plug and play, eliminating most of the risk of those embarrassing moments where no one can get the projector to work.  Most of the functionality also comes through the remote as well.  You can also put the sound through the projector, and I love the retractable tilting foot on the device.  It's small, boots up quickly, is easy to use, and is really impressive with its picture, even for playing movies.  That's a great side benefit, but as you start looking into its use as a movie machine, that's where you really start looking at higher end models, and it's hard to know where to stop, because they make a few models much more geared toward movies well beyond the EX7220.<br /><br />This is a great machine.  I'd recommend Epson to anyone based on my experience.  As for which model to buy, I'd tell you to take a careful look at your needs.  This model is great for ease of use and quality of picture for basic office uses.",B00GMGDH38,B00MA7YE44,AGRPLHGW2CR6WWOHT5TOWXDGIZEQ,04:53.0,0,FALSE,4177,3.8,5,4

5,"Different, but maybe better, than the previous generation...","This is a really excellent product, although I must say that I was worried considering how many poor reviews I read, even though I knew most of them were just whining about product availability and price.<br /><br />The front cover is thin, but I don't worry about it bending.  It looks nice, with appropriate materials inside and out.  It could use something to help it stay shut, but I don't really see that being an issue.  It is meant to be moved 180 degrees to get it out of your way.<br /><br />The difference between this and the ""touch"" version, which I bought for my sister, is that this has cutouts for the side buttons, thankfully.  The back is basically a rubber composite surround that holsters the Kindle very nicely.<br /><br />This cover doesn't detract in any way, but adds basic protection and the functionality of the light.  I've been using the light surprisingly often, and find it comfortable, although when using the light, I do make it point to hold the Kindle parallel to my face because holding it even somewhat perpendicular will have the light shining in one's eyes.<br /><br />Price:  Sheesh!  Yes, it is expensive.  And I am one of those people that won't buy something I want even if I can afford it if I think that someone (or a company) is trying to screw me.  But this is a quality product, and to me it is worth it.  I like to buy something one time and always be happy with it.  That seems to have been the case with this cover.  I do take price into account on my reviews, but in this case, it does not lose a star.<br /><br />Availability:  Who knows.  Maybe Amazon pushed it back just to tempt a few without patience to buy something else just to hold them over (I went on a couple of flights and lugged it around in its original packaging during the time I was waiting).  But I doubt it:  Amazon may be a giant company, but they never seem to be underhanded (if only because they know it's not a good business model).  More likely they had a schedule slip, but still wanted to release the Kindle well before the holidays.

Took me all of 5 minutes.<br /><br />The cameras themselves aren't feature rich - you're not going to find tilt/swivel/zoom or even night vision.  But you can't expect it from cameras that operate in 2 AA for up to 2 years!  They do what they're designed to do: basic monitoring with motion detection in a completely wireless setup (you can literally place the cameras anywhere!).  An LED light can illuminate any recording  in darkness.<br /><br />There's no monthly service fee either - but the recordings you can take are only up to a minute long and there's a limit on how many.<br /><br />I love these cameras for their ease of setup and complete mobility.  The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is the lack of an outdoor camera option and a little bit buggy iOS app.<br /><br />Update (11/27/2017): a couple negatives to the cameras:<br />(1) while each camera comes with a wall mount, orienting it just right (in my case on a front porch so I could see who's at the door) isn't all that easy (just because the camera doesn't have an area in its view doesn't mean it won't detect motion slightly outside it!)<br />(2) the cameras have no speakers.  I knew this when buying, of course, but competing cameras in same price range do.<br />(3) I just asked Blink whether there are any plans for Apple HomeKIt support - and there aren't :-(  This is a big negative for me because I'm starting to do some home automation and since we're an Apple household, I want HomeKit.

5,"Hard to beat in terms of value for the price, but it has its limitations","While these headphones won't excite an audiophile, if you want to spend as little as possible on a set of headphones but not make too many concessions with regard to comfort and sound quality, this is the set to get. For $25 you get headphones that sound way better than you would expect for the price point, and are also pretty comfortable to wear for extended periods.<br /><br />The build quality is OK. Again, these are $25 headphones, but they are pretty decently made. They will not stand up to rough handling, but as long as they are treated with care, they will provide a good service life. The earpads are comfortable and do a good job of blocking out ambient noise. It has an attached cord that has both a 1/4 inch and a 3.5mm jack. You have to screw off the 1/4 inch one to expose the 3.5mm one. While I like the convenient way it provides 2 different jacks, I would have much preferred to have a detachable cord. But again, for the price, it's not a deal killer by any means.<br /><br />The sound quality for the price is excellent. No, it doesn't sound as good as a $200 set, but it's reasonably clear, decently punchy, and doesn't significantly distort at high volumes.<br /><br />If you're looking for the best value in a headphone, it's hard to beat this.

5,Outstanding screen; solid performance; great form factor; couple of irritations,"Bottom line: Overall, this is an excellent laptop/tablet setup. The screen is simply gorgeous, the speed is excellent, and it easily morphs between a laptop and a tablet. Windows 8 can be a bit of a pain, as can some of the hardware design quirks, but overall, I’m finding it to be a solid performer. It's a good choice if you want a tablet but don't want to give up the functionality of a laptop.<br /><br />Full review: It’s been a couple of years since I tried out a laptop/tablet “convertible” type system, and things have certainly improved for the better. This Asus is a fully functional system in both its tablet and laptop modes.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed when I first opened the box since it was not packaged in a “high end” (ala Apple) manner. It was packed well in terms of protection, but it was pretty utilitarian. I also thought it was unusual that there was no setup or “welcome” sheet/poster packed with the hardware.<br /><br />The utilitarian feel went away once I started using it. The overall fit and finish is excellent – very solid feeling. It is thinner than I expected – folded up it’s just a bit thicker than my older tablets. The tablet portion alone is sleek and solid. You do notice the weight when using just the tablet, but it’s not bad. My only quibble is that the tablet case is slippy in hand. The keyboard has non-slip feet on it that keep it well-planted, but when using just the tablet, it’s slidy. I’m shopping for a case or skin to help with the hand feel of the tablet.<br /><br />Setup was straightforward, with Win 8 going through the usual setup process of a couple of minutes to get the basics taken care of, then an hour or so of having it fetch and install all the needed OS updates. I used Win 8 for a bit when it came out, but mostly work with Win 7 machines. It was a pleasant surprise to see how well Microsoft has buffed the rough edges off of Win 8. I can’t say that I love it (I'm more of an Android fan when it comes to touch screens) but it’s a very workable OS that is (mostly) easy to use. Granted, the very first thing I did was install Chrome since IE is a total pain, but overall, Win 8 is not bad. But, I want to keep this review focused on the hardware rather than Win 8.<br /><br />The shining star of the tablet is the screen. It is absolutely gorgeous in terms of resolution, be it text (which was a treat for these old eyes since young programmers seem to think everyone can read 2 point type) or video. The viewing angle is excellent, the colors are rich and vibrant. Asus did an excellent job with the screen.<br /><br />The touch sensitivity of the screen is also excellent. I don't use a stylus and am able to reliably hit everything I aim or swipe for. That’s saying a lot given my less than nimble fingers.<br /><br />The keyboard is good but not great. The key feel is decent, as is the layout, but the keys and the frame feels cheap compared with the more solid feel of the tablet. The touch pad is decent, but there's not much need for it given the excellent touch screen. The docking between the tablet and the keyboard is very well made – easy to attach, pretty easy to detach, and it maintains a very secure grip. I had no problems switching between the virtual and the physical keyboard (which uses Bluetooth to connect with the tablet).<br /><br />The tablet has no fan but does not heat up much. I can feel some warmth on the right side of the tablet back after it has been operating for a few hours, but it’s just warm, rather than hot. And I certainly don’t miss the fan noise. The internal drive is solid state, so there truly is zero operating sound. The claimed run time of about 8 hours is accurate.<br /><br />The operating speed is snappy. I noticed zero lag time switching between apps/programs, and no significant slowdown when running multi-tasking programs. I attribute this to both a decent speed for the processor, plus the solid state drive.<br /><br />The sound quality is just OK. It's pretty clear, but sounds tinny and lacks any measure of punch or bass. That's not surprising given how small the speakers have to be. The sound quality is adequate for basic audio, such as watching a YouTube video, but for anything else you'll probably want to use an external speaker. I paired it with an external Bluetooth speaker for streaming music, and even though the external speaker was not high end, the sound quality improvement was significant.<br /><br />What I don’t care for is how USB devices are connected. It has a dongle which attaches to the tablet. It works, but it’s ungainly. I would have loved to have a conventional USB port built into the tablet (or keyboard) even at the expense of the needed extra thickness. On the plus side, the dongle worked fine with every USB device I tried it with (various external drives, printers, camera). In addition to the USB output it can read an SD card plus has an HDMI output port.<br /><br />It’s a bit of a pain to open the tablet when it’s docked with the keyboard and folded up. The hinge tightness works against you when trying to get it open. Lastly, the charger has a wall wart on the end which can be problematic when trying to plug it into a loaded power strip.<br /><br />While there are negatives, they are mostly of the irritating nature rather than the truly interfering nature. This is a solid device that provides excellent functionality as a tablet and provides good laptop functionality. The Win 8 OS allows you to use the full range of Windows application software plus an extensive number of apps. While it won’t fully replace a “real” laptop since it lacks items that I would want in a laptop (such as a built-in DVD drive and a better keyboard), it offers far more utility than just a tablet and does so at a good price point. The negatives drop it to 4.5 stars, but I’ll round up to 5 stars since the screen is truly outstanding.",B00T7XR888,B00T7XR888,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,02:09.0,45,FALSE,5908,4,5,4
5,Better alternative to My K-cup option; easy to get good results,"This is a much easier alternative to the My K-cup option if you want to use your own coffee in a K-cup machine rather than the pre-packaged cups. Unlike the My K-cup you don't need to remove the inner cup of the machine to use this. It just drops right in, so you can switch between this and a regular k-cup without having to dismantle anything.<br /><br />The kit is very complete. There are three cups, each a slightly different color (different shades of brown). The cups are decently made. The plastic sides are nice and thick; the o-ring on the cap is of good quality; and the metal mesh is firmly attached. My only quibble with the build quality is the hinge. It's plastic, and I don't have confidence that it will last a long time before breaking. It's not a big deal, since the cup will still work fine even with a broken hinge, so I'm not docking any points due to that potential problem.<br /><br />I like that the water dispersion channel has slots all around it to ensure water gets sprayed in all directions inside the cup to keep the grounds uniformly wet. I also really like that the lip area has a slight indent to make it very easy to pop open the top with one hand.<br /><br />It fit fine in my Cuisinart K-cup machine. The lid of the machine was just slightly raised compared with using a ""real"" k-cup, but it had zero impact on performance. I tried several different brews, all with good results. You will need to fiddle with the grind level to get the best coffee. Too fine of a grind and it gets over-extracted and bitter; too coarse and it's weak.<br /><br />Cleaning a used cup is very easy. I pop open the top, hold it upside down in the compost pail, and whack it gently on the base with a wooden spoon. Nearly all the used grounds drop out, and what's left can be easily rinsed under running water. You can also just dump the contents into the disposal or garbage if you don't compost your grounds.<br /><br />Another option is to use a mini filter in the cup. A package of them are included and, while they do make cleanup easier, I prefer to use just the cup without a filter.<br /><br />The kit also includes a charcoal filter. I didn't use that, so I can't speak to its performance. It looks to be the same size as the filters used in the water intake of my Cuisinart K-cup machine, so I expect it would perform in a similar fashion.<br /><br />This Smart Cup kit works well, is well-made/designed, and comes in a very complete kit. Having used the My K-cup version I can confidently say that this performs better and is easier to use. Highly recommend.<br />[Sample provided for review]",B00T56FCNU,B00T56FCNU,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,56:47.0,0,FALSE,2618,4.5,5,5
4,"Decent entry-level macro flash, but expect a lot of plastic","While this macro light has some middling quality issues at times, it does offer a viable, and very cost effective alternative to pricier setups.<br /><br />The light comes with eight lens adapters to cover most of the common applications (49mm, 52mm, 55mm, 58mm, 62mm, 67mm, 72mm, 77mm). The adapters are plastic rather than metal which gives me some concerns about durability. I would have liked to see metal adapters since other low-price setups offer them instead of plastic.<br /><br />The flash offers a continuous light setting, or a flash setting to time with your exposure. You can set it to use all 48 LEDs or just half (can select either the right or the left half).<br /><br />It’s powered by a battery pack that takes 4AA batteries. The battery contacts on mine were initially out of place and would not make proper contact with the batteries. After adjusting the position of the contacts with a screwdriver, things worked fine. The screen includes a battery level indicator so you always know how much juice is left.<br /><br />You can mount the control head on your camera using the hotshoe, or use it off-camera with an included stand. The stand is really light-duty but reasonably functional.<br /><br />The control head screen is very easy to read. The controls allow for light output brightness adjustments with a simple plus/minus key system, and mode selection (all/half, flash, stead light). There's also a button to test the light output. The buttons are large and well-labeled as to function.<br /><br />Note that this unit does not allow for delayed/second curtain synch flash.<br /><br />It includes four diffusers (white, blue, yellow, clear/semi-translucent) that are easy to attach and remove (twist and lift).<br /><br />I tested this with a Canon 5D mark II and the Canon L 100mm macro and had zero problems with functionality (other than the battery issue listed above).<br /><br />This is not pro-quality gear but it’s also not pro-level in terms of price. It’s a great way to play around with macro lighting to see if it’s something you find helpful. The all-plastic design keeps this at the 4 star level, but I would certainly recommend it provided you don’t subject it to a lot of heavy use.<br />[Sample provided for review]",B00JO64MY6,B00JO64MY6,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,23:18.0,31,FALSE,2260,4.5,4,5
5,Sturdy construction; good performance,"This is a specialized take on a pretty conventional product: a 2.0 USB hub. Unlike most hubs, however, this allows you to attach a device 30+ feet away from the PC.<br /><br />It looks much like a conventional USB hub, except for the fact that the cable that plugs into the PC is 32 feet long. The construction quality is quite good - the cable ends are solid and well-made; the connectors appear sturdy; and the cable itself coils nicely even though it is pretty thick.<br /><br />The one area that could be improved is the device attachment end. There are 4 female USB ports in an ""octopus"" configuration (e.g., the ends are splayed out). I would have liked to have more flexibility in the connection end with more separation between the connectors.<br /><br />But that nitpick aside, I've not had any problems with functionality. I'm using it for low-powered USB devices and have had no problems with signal/power strength. I would (and as recommended by the manufacturer) use a powered connection for more power-hungry devices, such as an external drive.<br />[Sample provided for review]",B00E3NUU5A,B00E3NUU5A,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,13:46.0,1,FALSE,1092,3.7,5,4
5,Easy to use storage option,"Very pleased with the drive. Installation was truly plug and play - it took longer to get the drive out of its packaging than it did to install. Not often that you can say that with regard to a PC product!<br /><br />The speed running on a USB 2.0 connection is very good. I didn't run any formal time tests, but it copied megabytes of files just as quick as any other external drive I've used. I can't comment on the backup software since I use a program that I wrote myself.<br /><br />I love the fact that this can be upgraded to USB 3.0. None of my PCs presently have that option, but I expect the next one will and it's good to know that this drive can take advantage of the extra speed. Unfortunately, that's an extra cost item, but still far cheaper than having to get a whole new drive.<br /><br />The drive enclosure is stylish (well, as stylish as a PC component can be). Quiet when running, and I'm pleased that the indicator lights are not the lighthouse beacon-style that seems to be in favor these days. You can see them, but they are not distracting.<br /><br />I've been using Seagate external drives for years and have never had a problem - they just keep on ticking no matter what. In addition to this model I have a portable GoFlex (320 GB) that has been running nearly 24/7 for the past two-plus years without even a hiccup, and a non-portable 250GB that has been running for about seven-plus years, again with zero problems. Amazing that the 2 TB model is actually a wee bit smaller than the six year old 250 GB model!<br /><br />Hoping that this model will continue the streak of zero failures with my Seagates. Highly recommend.",B003ELOSJG,B003T9VQ98,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,11:43.0,1,FALSE,1651,4.6,5,5
4,Does exactly what I hoped it would do; some customer support reservations,"I decided to get the Colormunki after struggling for over a year to get my Canon Pro9000 printer to produce prints that were consistently accurate representations of my photos, as they looked on my monitor - I had a monitor calibrator, but that's only one part of what you need in color management. I had used generic profiles for the paper I was using in the past and did all thing things you are supposed to do with the color management settings to get things right, but still experienced highly inconsistent results. After much reading, I determined that getting custom profiles for my printer/paper combinations might be the way to go.  The Colormunki allows you to profile your printer specifically for the paper you are using, in addition to calibrating your monitor.<br /><br />The profiler controls are easily understood and engaged; in order to profile the printer you will need to use at least two sheets of whatever paper you are profiling, and you will need to profile for each type of paper you use - each paper gets its own custom profile - so there is some initial expenditure of ink and paper to get your profiles ready. But that's nothing compared to the ink and paper you would have wasted trying to get an acceptable print without a custom profile, so I don't see that as a disadvantage.<br /><br />Things did not go smoothly at first though - you're supposed to use the Colormunki to scan a series of color patches and when I first printed out my color patches my printer was apparently low on magenta and did not properly print out the patches that had magenta in it.  I was unaware of that, and as I attempted to scan the patches, the Colormunki would simply tell me the scan had failed and not offer any tips as to where to begin locating the point of failure.  It wasn't until I used the online help and wandered in and out of several articles (their online article resource is not well-organized) that I finally stumbled on a sentence that pointed me in the right direction.  Once over that hurdle, the profiling proceeded very quickly and very easily.  I was then able to make more profiles without any hitches at all.  But my review gets 4 stars instead of 5, as I believe the makers of Colormunki could have done a much better job in creating and organizing the help documentation.  There needs to be more of an effort on their part to address the questions that might arise for a user that has no knowledge of the finer points of color profiling - their help documentation seems to gloss over a number of things, or assume that the user would already know them.  Given that the product is marketed to the general consumer, this is potentially a serious misstep on their part.<br /><br />I cannot speak for the projector profiler feature as I do not have a use for that and have not tested it.<br /><br />In summary, I've seen a vast improvement in the color accuracy of my prints since using the Colormunki, but be aware that troubleshooting any problems with this product can lead to a lot of frustration if you don't already have the expertise that  would help you know where to start looking.",B00169N0BK,B00169N0BK,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,46:26.0,9,TRUE,3124,4.6,4,5
5,95% as strong as a Clearstream 4,"I recently purchase an Antenna's Direct Clearstream 4 to use in my attic to feed the TVs in the BR and LR. Works fantastic, so when I needed another antenna for a TV in the study that I could not hook up to the antenna in the attic, I again went with Antenna's Direct, but this time picked the DB2 since it was smaller (and cheaper).<br /><br />Absolutely fantastic reception! The only station it does not pull in as well as the Clearstream 4 was one fringe station. As with the Clearstream 4 positioning is a breeze - I just propped it up in the corner!<br /><br />Given how well it performs, I thought I'd see how it does in the attic in place of the much larger and more expensive Clearstream. It does nearly as well - all the major networks come in equally good, and the DB2 picks up all but one of the more distant stations. The one it misses is a channel I never watch anyway, so for me, the two are equal.<br /><br />For me (located outside Wash DC) the antennas pull in 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 9.1, 9.2, 14.1, 20.1, and about a dozen PBS stations rock solid.  Channels 66.1 to 66.4 are so-so on the DB2 and pretty good on the Clearstream 4.<br /><br />The Clearstream 4 also pulls in several analog stations. I didn't try that with the DB2 so I don't know if it will work with analog. Come February, the point will be moot anyway, so I didn't bother to test it out for analog.<br /><br />So, if you're debating between the Clearstream 4 and the DB2 (or DB4), give the DB2 a shot first - the little guy may do the trick, and you can save quite a bit of cash.",B000EHUE7I,B000EHUE7I,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,56:12.0,2,TRUE,1574,4.5,5,5

4,"Acer C720 Chromebook (11.6-Inch, 2GB) ...","These are pretty much the perfect laptop for kids (and adults too if they don't want to download or install any personal programs).  The Google App store has just about every type of app/program you could want.  These don't have a DVD drive and you can't download programs unless they are from the App store.  It's a good way of keeping your machine safe from malware attacks.  No need to purchase and renew antiviral software.  The screen is clear and bright, and the keyboard works really nicely.  The sound from these is much better than the sound on my much more expensive laptop.  Overall, the size and functionality of the Chromebook is much better than my new Windows 8.1 laptop.<br /><br />My kids were able to get started immediately with minimal help from me to download some apps they like, get their e-mails set up and started using these Chromebooks immediately.  I personally am not nuts about having only Google Chrome as my internet browser, thus I don't own my own Chromebook, but for my kids purposes (mainly games and schoolwork) the Chromebooks work out great.  I really like how easy and smoothly they work.  They are faster than my laptop and I do find that appealing, but I like being able to use a DVD drive and to be able to download what software I might want from the internet.<br /><br />Printing is possible from the cloud and set up to do that is not difficult.  Everything is easy........almost too easy.  You can't store any data on the computer itself, only in the cloud.

5,Beautiful watch with even more features and faster software.,"This is the best of them yet! I received a gold Darci watch and noticed how much faster it was to set up right away; the previous model took upwards of 15 minutes and this took less than three? The face is big and beautiful and I am a little worried about keeping it in its mint condition so I take it off when I get home so I don't ding it while carrying things around the house, etc. The display is dazzling and I like the way you can switch faces. The watch takes you through a tutorial after set up and you really won't need to use it again. My favorite new features are the improved and expanded health apps/widgets like Cardiogram and Google Fit, which now has a breathing exercise included! I felt it wonderful to be able to unwind WITH the watch before taking it off. I find those more useful than the GPay features, though contactless payments are also a bonus in these times.<br /><br />The watch comes with a start guide, warranty info, and charging cable, all beautifully packaged.

I understand there were some problems with audio in the earlier versions, but it seems to be all fixed now because the sound quality was excellent when tested both indoors and outside.<br /><br />I won't bore you with going over all of the specs which you can read in the product description, but I'll tell you how easy it is to use. Mine arrived partially charged, so I used my fingernail to open the back port and inset the included 8gb micro SD card, then charged it fully within an hour.  On a full battery it can operate for about 107 minutes and when depleted it takes between 1.5 to 2 hrs to fully charge.<br /><br />I downloaded the app to my iPad for free from the app store, then did some testing. It connected easily to my WiFi and the interface understandable and easy to use giving you the choice to shoot still photos or videos in several different resolutions. You can also import the photos or videos taken with the camera to your cell phone, your iPad, or share them using the WiFi connection to import them.<br /><br />This little camera takes gorgeous high def photos, and the audio inside is crystal clear.  When I was offered the opportunity by the manufacturer to test the Cube+ I went ahead and purchased a [[ASIN:B00NXK3JTI Polaroid Helmet Mount for the Polaroid CUBE, CUBE+ HD Action Lifestyle Camera]] so I would be able to properly test it in action in order to determine video and sound quality outside in the elements.<br /><br />I attached the helmet mount to my 9 y/o granddaughter's helmet, placed the Cube+ in it, started it through the app on my iPad and sent her out on her scooter to see how the video and audio quality was. I've attached a short part of the video here so you can assess it for yourself, but I'm quite pleased with the quality of both the picture and the sound, and I didn't experience any lag time in regards to the app.<br /><br />It does record video in MP4 format, so if you have trouble hearing the audio on your computer you should download QuickTime Player or VLC Player. Both downloads are free and should allow you to view the files and hear the audio. VLC also has a free converter available in case you prefer to use Windows Media Player or Windows Movie Maker. I use a free app called Trim &amp; Cut on my iPad which shortens, condenses, and converts my videos to the format I prefer, and that's what I used for the video I've attached here.<br /><br />This is a reasonably priced tough little action camera that's easy to use and produces great quality video. It's weather resistant and splashproof so it can handle the outdoors already, but I plan to buy the waterproof case for it so we can have fun swimming with it on this summer. I don't own a GoPro, so I have nothing to compare this to, but from a user's stand point I can definitely tell you that this is user friendly, easy to operate and does a remarkably good job!

5,Great sound!,"I’m being honest, I received an email from this company to try their sound bar for free & leave a review. They did not say it had to be positive, just a review.

I figured why not give this one a try & I’m so glad I did. This is a positive review simply because I absolutely recommend this sound bar!<br />So on our old one, movies were terrible to watch, especially our favorite action movies. The action scene was stupid loud & the voices were crazy low. Yes, i researched it & did everything possible with the controls & it didn’t matter, that bar just didn’t distribute the sound well.<br />Turned this one on & even my kids were excited. My daughter said it sounds pretty & it doesn’t hurt your ears, lol<br />She was amazed at the different little small sounds in the background we never picked up but were crystal clear with this bar. So far we are all very happy with it.<br />I will update if anything goes wrong or it stops working & I will update on customer service as well if needed. Even though I did get it free, that aspect does not take away from the fact that this thing is awesome. I’m so glad I answered that email.

The center column is also a short 15mm rod, this means you can mount a 15mm rod vertically onto the base when needed. The bottom of the support column has a 1/4"" nut, when removed, you can mount any 1/4"" screw when needed.

The touch screen is responsive and easy to use.  It's well made and doesn't feel cheap.  The windshield mount works easily and holds the unit in place.<br /><br />When you register the unit at the Navigon website, you'll find out that a software update is not necessary as of today.  FreshMaps is supposed to be available this month (July) and you can sign up for E-mail notification as to when they'll be ready for download.  The unit comes with a 2 gig memory card and you can install a larger one when it's needed.  The operating system for the mapping program is Windows CE.

It does what I need without a load of unnecessary bells and whistles.<br /><br />August 3, 2008: As of today, FreshMaps update is now available for this unit.  Just go to the Navigon website, log into your account and download the Navigon downloader program.  Install the program on your computer and you're ready to go.  You can even backup your old maps with this downloader program which is recommended before you download the new maps and install them.<br /><br />October 1, 2008:  Navigon now gives you FREE lifetime traffic information.

5,"Super Easy, Super Effective, but is missing USB-A","This review is for the Phixero SATA-to-USB 3.0 for 2.5/3.5 inch drives.  Which is also called (in the buttons) ""SATA Adapter with Power Adapter.""  That is to say, the unit with a power adapter.<br /><br />This is important.  The product page has something like six options.  You want THIS one if you're going to try to read data off of older drives or desktop drives, because those need the additional power.<br /><br />So, on to the review...<br /><br />The Phixero SATA for 3.5-inch drives is the most versatile SATA-to-USB converter I've seen, because it does something the others don't: It powers a 3.5"" drive.<br /><br />Small drives, the width of your cellphone, can be USB powered, but larger drives, like you may be pulling out of your desktop, are 3.5"" and take too much power for a USB-powered adapter to drive.  This converter includes a wall-wart to power the larger drives... and it works.<br /><br />There is a wrinkle though - the power-in from the 12V power supply and the corresponding 12V input on the converter use a USB-C connector.<br /><br />USB-C is 5 volts, not 12 volts, so this seems dangerous.  Specifically, the power adapter is dangerous, if you plug it into another device.<br /><br />With that out of the way, the other challenge is that this version, the powered version for larger hard drives, came with a USB-C end for the signal also, not the USB-A shown in the photo and there was no adapter in the box.  I wasn't expecting this, and I've never seen a USB-C to USB-A converter.  So that's a miss.<br /><br />So... moving from the system I intended to use it with, which doesn't have any USB-C ports, to a laptop that does, I plugged it in.<br /><br />Windows immediately recognized the USB ""Mass Storage Device.""  Great!<br /><br />I plugged in a drive I'd removed (after upgrading) from another system.  Windows chimed and immediately recognized it, and made it fully readable.  Complete win.<br /><br />This converter is small, works flawlessly, doesn't require (at least for Windows) drivers, and does everything you'd expect.  My only gripes are the power being 12 volts on USB-C and the data being USB-C without a USB-A adapter.  So, as long as you're cautious and you have USB-C inputs, this is literally perfect.",B0B4S7YRYD,B0C33CP17L,AFXRDEVBGBQT3YV5J5OHSUT6H6BA,11:53.7,0,FALSE,2255,4.9,5,5

4,"Very good, different than the Monoprice 4K monitor","I have both this Samsung monitor and the [[ASIN:B00TQ82R80 Monoprice 28in UHD LED CrystalPro 4K 60Hz monitor]].  On the same system.  I got the Monoprice first.  And I have a selection of other monitors, but what you really care about is how the Samsung compares to the Monoprice.<br /><br />Both are nice.  In different ways.<br /><br />The Samsung comes with an almost art-like stand.  It does one thing: it holds the monitor about four inches off the desk, in landscape mode, at 90° from the table.  The Monoprice monitor had all the adjustments - height, swivel (to portrait) and tilt.  And it's sturdier too.<br /><br />The Monoprice also comes with VESA-like mounts.  I don't notice that for the Samsung.  That doesn't matter to me, but that is how the stand attaches to the Monoprice.  The Samsung uses a slot, much like on high-end Apple displays.<br /><br />Samsung's menues are easier to navigate.  It isn't that the Monoprice one is hard, but the buttons are hidden. The Samsung uses a hidden control too, but it's a joystick (they call it a jog wheel), and it's really intuitive to use.  Very easy.<br /><br />The Monoprice has a glass screen, like some high-end Apple displays or a plasma TV.  Very crisp, very nice looking... very prone to reflections.  The Samsung has a standard LCD matte anti-reflective display.  No reflections, but doesn't seem as crisp either.  But... that is in direct comparison.  Compare the 157ppi to the 102ppi of a normal 22"" monitor and the Samsung is very crisp.  Just not as sharp as the Monoprice.<br /><br />The Samsung is brighter too.  Extremely bright.  Much more so than the Monoprice.  So if you're in a bright room with lots of sources for reflections, you'll want the Samsung.<br /><br />The bottom line is that both of these monitors are fantastic.  The Samsung is better for bright rooms, the Monoprice has a more flexible stand and seems crisper due to the glass screen.<br /><br />They both are crisp, the same resolution.  But the Monoprice looks crisper.",B00IEZGWI2,B00IEZGWI2,AFXRDEVBGBQT3YV5J5OHSUT6H6BA,29:38.0,4,TRUE,2015,4.5,4,5

3,"Fire HD 8""","edit two weeks later: The HD 8 has been returned. Short story: as a value tablet, or for a first-time user, it is a fine tablet. As an upgrade from an HDX. don't.<br /><br />I have a 3rd generation 7&#34; Fire HDX, which is two years older than this new 8&#34; HD model. I realize that the HD is NOT the HDX, but with those two years between, one would hope that the performance would typically improve to make the upgrade worthwhile. But even with the time difference, the specs on the HDX still best this new 8&#34; HD model. My HDX has been lovingly abused: the screen is scratched, it's been dropped, and the battery doesn't hold as much as it used to. I figured it was time for an upgrade, so I opted for this new 8&#34; HD model. There _is_ a newer 8.9 HDX, but that size does not appeal to me.<br /><br />This 8&#34; HD model feels sluggish. Unfortunately, a new operating system on top of things makes it even harder to judge (Fire OS 4.x on the HDX vs. Fire OS 5.x). More than once, I'm tapping, tapping, tapping an icon, not quite sure if it's not registering my taps, or if it's just slow to respond. There is noticeable light leakage around the whole bezel, but right where the SD card installs it is very noticeable. The case is a slick and glossy plastic which feels like it'll slip out of my hands any moment (unlike the rubbery-grippy material used on the HDX).<br /><br />At the gain of one inch screen real-estate, a rear camera, and an SD slot to make up the difference of a loss of internal memory, I am not sure the HD is a good upgrade from the 7&#34; HDX, and I'm strongly inclined to return it and holding out hope for a refresh of the smaller HDX model(s).",B00S5HFVGI,B0117U82EM,AHNM5TRS66Y25IPXQK432ERWCEPA,13:35.0,5,TRUE,1681,4.7,3,5
5,My go-to brand for screen protection,"I love the product and I love the price (there are many other protectors that are so much more expensive yet cannot beat the quality and ease of use). I've not had any issues with the screen protectors for my iPads or iPhones over the years.  So much easier to apply then any type of film protection, because it is a stiff, rigid, thin piece of material.  It is forgiving when you first apply the item to your screen to ensure it is aligned properly. Additionally, you start from the bottom, where the home button is located, which makes it much easier to align.<br /><br />You are provided with an electronics moist screen cleaner, a number of stickers to further remove any dust that may have fallen after cleaning, suction cups to help hold the protector while applying it, and the microfiber lint screen cleaner once you are finished. I also find the screen much easier to use once it is applied, it seems smoother and my fingers glide across the screen.<br /><br />The only issue I have ever had was, well, the product doing it's job. I dropped my brand-new iPad Pro and it hit the corner of my glass coffee table on its way to the floor, but the screen protector did exactly what it was supposed to do; it cracked the protector and saved my screen.<br /><br />I am a bit concerned about the reviews commenting on the customer service.

5,"NOT A BOSE SOUNDLINK  MINI II SPEAKER, But Still a Nice Speaker FOR THE PRICE.","I own a Bose SoundLink Mini II speaker and this Anker speaker is good, but not that good.  For a $50 to $60 speaker (still a little overpriced) this speaker can be loud and does a pretty good job with most music and Echo Dot.  I use this speaker in my bedroom with a Dot, a Bose SoundLink Mini II speaker in the livingroom with a Dot.  The Anker speaker works well with the Dot and hooks up through the Alexa App easily.  The sound is pretty decent for a speaker in this price range --again, I reiterate &#34;in this price range&#34;. Also, this is a very attractive unit and comes boxed and shipped carefully to the front door -- thank you, Amazon.  I have the first EARLY model (there's a newer model now) of the Large Amazon Basic Bluetooth Speaker.  This Anker speaker sounds almost identical to my older Amazon speaker, and they each cost the same -- around $60.00.  It would be difficult for me to determine which speaker is better, but I lean a little towards the older Amazon unit, but this is just a subjective opinion because the two speakers are very close in sound.  The older model Amazon speaker (don't know about the newer model of the same speaker) always turns itself off which made it unusable for the Dot.  The Anker speaker stays on all the time and, therefore, always ready for Alexa to use.  Even though this Anker speaker is not in the Bose ballpark, it's a good speaker for the money.  I would not pay more than $60.00 for this speaker.  It's original price of $100.00 is way too muchot.<br /><br />EDIT: Now that I have had more time with using this speaker I find that the overall sound is better coming from my Amazon large basic speaker.  If I had to choose between the Anker speaker and the Amazon speaker, I would choose the Amazon speaker.  However, the Anker speaker is very attractive, and the sound is okay, not great, but okay.

5,"""Auto Off"" Can Be Disabled!","I was looking for a good bluetooth speaker to go with my Echo Dot.  One tech article I read about this Bose speaker stated that the speaker would turn itself off unless the Dot was connected to it via an aux cable.  Before I ordered this speaker I contacted Bose in order to find out if the &#34;Auto Off&#34; could be neutralized.  Bose told me to press and hold the Bluetooth and Volume + buttons at the same time.  A voice will prompt and confirm the auto off setting is now off.  To reinstate Auto Off hold the same buttons down and the speaker will tell you that Auto Off is reinstated.  These directions are not included with the speaker.  I ordered this Bose Sound Link Mini Bluetooth Speaker II and found the auto off directions to work beautifully.  I LOVE THIS SPEAKER!  The sound is wonderful.  It hooked up easily through the Alexa app to my Echo Dot, and we had clear lovely sounding music playing Christmas Eve night and Christmas morning.  Since the Dot and this speaker do not need to be attached to each other I can move the speaker all over the house.  I leave the speaker sitting on its charging base all the time and have not had any adverse reactions.  When completely depleted of power the battery took about a couple of hours to recharge.  I did not have to reset any of its settings other than to make sure the Bluetooth was on, and then tell the Dot to reconnect -- easy.  If you are even just a semi-audiophile I think you will really like/love this little speaker.",B00WK47VEW,B017T99JPG,AFRRY33UKK3KLUJXWVA3OXLAJMEA,59:28.0,8,TRUE,1491,5,5,5

4,Overall good product but with a design flaw,"I was looking for a USB 3.0 enclosure (with fan) for my 3.5 inch HDD and they are not easy to find. No matter what anyone says, you need an enclosure with fan to regulate HDD temperature. I have tried full metal enclosure without fan in the past and they didn't do a good job limiting the HDD temperature. The fan in this enclosure did a good job and the HDD temperature was kept below 34C even after few hours of operation. Data transfer speed was on par with typical USB 3.0 so that's good. Also, the pull and rotate stand was pretty cool. My biggest issue with this product is the press open door (removing one star). HDD enclosure is a product in which once the HDD is installed it remains closed for years. Why would you install a press mechanism which is supported by flimsy plastic parts when all you need is couple of screws. The placement of the press mechanism is such that when you pick up the enclosure, you may accidently open the enclosure door. If this issue is fixed, then its a great product.",B07D72Z4XD,B07NWG8HXS,AH6FXNRZKTBAPKJWWJCJWLTSB6PQ,48:39.7,2,TRUE,1009,3.3,4,3

I tend to engage my subject in conversation while I'm composing a shot and then capture the image when I see an authentic look/pose/expression, and sometimes these opportunities occur in rapid succession. I've often found myself waiting for a speedlite to recycle and missing shots, or getting underexposed shots. Not so with the AD200. It's ready to fire whenever I'm ready to press the shutter.

5,Love my new Paperwhite,"The Paperwhite is my third Kindle. My other two were the keyboard versions.  I have had my Paperwhite for two weeks now and have been giving it a great workout.  I felt it rated 5 stars because it has surpassed my expectations.  I have been reading a whole lot, at least 5 books, in the past two weeks, and it is stil half-charged.  I love the light, and the directions for using it in varying light works perfectly.  I love the cloud listing of my books, and seeing the covers.  Also like the cover I purchased which turns the kindle off when you close it and on again when you open it.  When I order books they come in way less than a minute, sometimes it is almost instantly.<br /><br />When it arrived, it came preloaded with all my books, and was ready to use.  Tat was wonderful.  The only thing I would say is a bit, and I do mean just a bit, of an annoyance is that I wish there were one more choice of font size.  There are lots of smaller ones, but there should be one more between the second largest and the third largest font<br />size.  The jump between sizes is too big.  There needs to be one more.  As you get older the smaller ones are too small, yet you don't quite need those first two size.  It's is a small thing, though.<br /><br />I have recommended the Paperwhite to anyone who is vaguely interested in Kindles.  I think this one is particularly easy to use, is small enough to carry around easily, and can be read anywhere with that light.  Thanks for a great product!<br /><br />One other thing. Before I bought my Kindle I had read many complaints about the light and the shadows from the light.  There are some small shadow s on the bottom of the page, but they are very small and in no way interfere with the reading.  I just don't notice them when reading.

Cell phone was just too small to get a good view of all without being distracted from the traffic.<br /><br />The medium clamp base was so I could remove all when not in use. B size 1"" mount balls are just too small for the weight of the tablet and so I use the C size 1.5 "" balls which come with this one. They're rated to handle 4 lbs safely.

I had it running over night while I slept and it was still running when I woke up.  It wasn't on the highest setting, because that was just too much wind for me while I slept.  Middle setting and it was just enough to move the air for me.  I love that it's portable and it's light to carry.  When I work outside, I can bring it with me and set it on the table or on the floor.  The fan can be tilted, that's another great feature.

For example, if your laptop comes with bootable M2 or NVME or PCLE chip SSD, then you can add an extra HDD or Sata SSD into the extra drive bay. Other than that, this drive bay should fit into a 3.5 inch desktop space easily.

You could upgrade the regular hard drive to SSD if you want. Amazon has Samsung SSD with great warranty period at a reasonable price. The processor and picture quality of the screen are the best parts of the laptop. 16 GB RAM is more than sufficient to handle multiple applications and big data computation.<br /><br />The keyboard is soft and comfortable enough to type everyday. I can type for an hour without rest since I am a touch typist.<br /><br />However the only con is the back surface of the laptop could easily got finger print when you touch it.

3,The worst of many,"I have purchased a half dozen or more of these type of VESA wall mounts in the past year in this price range. This is the worst of the bunch. I used this to mount my LG 34UM95-P. My two main criticisms are the selection of mounting options for the bracket to TV/monitor and the cover for the wall bracket. For this monitor, the instructions would have you attach the bracket directly to the monitor. There were no nylon washers, etc. so it is guaranteed to mark up your TV/monitor if it is silver, etc. I used some scotch tape on the back the bracket, but there were no appropriate options for screws/spaces. I couldn't use the provided nylon spacers because the short screws were too short and the long ones too long. I ended up having to use the short screws with two washers for a stand off to mount the bracket tight enough not to slide around. Every other similar mount I have purchased comes with a plastic shield that slides over the entire wall bracket. This one comes with two nylon screw caps. It doesn't look good. In my case, I was mounting the bracket butted up to some window trim and needed to drive the lag screws at an angle, so the screw caps didn't work at all. Bottom line, there are better options in this price range that have more mounting options and a better option for covering the wall bracket.",B01NBTEMWC,B09BN2Q571,AHRAHYYB5MQZ5UQ63FS5KF4PACYQ,28:14.1,0,FALSE,1321,3.9,3,4

Given size and light weight it would be nice to pack in a bag to use with electronics. The only thing I would have liked is an indicator or light showing how much charge was left, but not a deal breaker.

Quiet, but gives enough breeze to keep the air circulating around me.",B09XD62QBT,B09XD62QBT,AFKVE5HRFK3X27DPXME72PUR5NXQ,54:47.6,1,TRUE,383,3.4,5,3
5,Great side-light,Nice warm light to keep to the side during my videos.  Recently upgraded to a new webcam and needed something more mobile to use as a key light.  This has a nice rubberized clamp so it can be attacked to pretty much anything.  I plan to get a side-camera for my setup and this will give me ample light at all angles.<br /><br />Has warm settings as well as white light.  I've got it running warm so I'm not too blue.  Very impressed for such a small ring light.  I'm pretty pleased with it.,B08ZJ9TZXH,B08ZJ9TZXH,AFKVE5HRFK3X27DPXME72PUR5NXQ,26:48.8,1,TRUE,490,5,5,5
5,Really cool stuff.,"This is my first 360° dash cam, and I don't think I can go back to the old style.  You can see everything to the left, front, and right of your vehicle.  It'd definitely be an advantage if you were in an accident so you can see everything that was going on around you.<br /><br />Image is clear in all views, and it does a pretty good job at night. The software lets you export the original file to video usable on any computer.  You can even adjust the angles if you choose.  The software works well, but I had some issues running it in Windows 10.  You need to run it in compatibility mode for Windows 7.  Any major issues, I could fix by rebooting my computer.<br /><br />Initially, I did have issues with the microphone, but I contacted the seller and will be getting a replacement at no cost.<br /><br />Overall a really cool camera.",B088WLQJ66,B088WLQJ66,AFKVE5HRFK3X27DPXME72PUR5NXQ,55:43.9,1,TRUE,838,4.3,5,4

I am optimistic they will perform well with a good service lifetime. I use them for situations where the eneloops don't seem to last as long as I would like. These batteries have a slightly larger charge capacity. So far, I have not been disappointed. But, with the promise of hundreds of charge cycles, they're barely getting broke in, at this point.

4,A major design flaw-,"This is an awesome bag although it will not fit a DSLR with an attached lens- it's about a half inch to narrow (front to back) and it's also too narrow to fit any of my lenses in by themselves.  The construction is sturdy and it's well padded. This would be a great bag for travel- the main compartment is zippered with the flap that covers and the storage pocket it  held down with a quick release buckle, and also a hefty piece of Velcro. If you want to access your camera quickly this is not the bag for you. However it's pretty unlikely that anyone can grab your gear in a crowded airport without having a noticeable wrestling match with your bag.The dividers in the bag are attached with very strong Velcro- which is part of the primary design flaw. The drawing shows a second set of smaller storage areas underneath the main dividers however there is no outside access to them. This means taking your gear out of the main dividers and then removing the bottom of the dividers to access what ever is in those areas. They are secure, but almost impossible to get to, and I don't want to remove my lenses and then deal with the velcro just to get to my spare battery or hard drive.<br /><br />The quality and workmanship of this bag is excellent. Although it is a slim profile bag I did not have problems with it tipping over like another reviewer mentioned but that probably comes with taking time to pack a balanced load. Unfortunately the overall size of the bag and inaccessibility of the bottom compartments was a deal breaker for me so I returned it.",B007234FCW,B007234FCW,AGFRQ2VRTTUFY54UZHFHB6M5HN3A,47:58.0,1,TRUE,1559,4.3,4,4

5,"it has a nice weight, and is very solid feeling","Received the tablet yesterday, here are some initial impressions to those who are interested:<br />(Background: I am a lifelong Apple guy, own several ipads, iphones, macs, apple shareholder etc)<br /><br />Build quality-- very impressive, this is not a cheap feeling device. it has a nice weight, and is very solid feeling. the back of the device is a plastic type material but overall nice.<br /><br />Screen quality-- it is not a high definition &#34;retina&#34; type display, but it is also quite nice. good viewing angles, I would liken the display to the pre-retina ipad displays.<br /><br />User experience (speed)-- again not bad at all, I thought it would be laggy but it's not, it's actually quite smooth.<br /><br />Apps-- I am not an Android/Amazon user, but there seems to be a decent amount of apps. I like spotify, and the good thing with spotify is that you can play any song from your playlists (from a tablet) so this would be a great use for this device, the speaker sounds Mono but the volume is decent. There seems to be a decent amount of games available from first glance.<br /><br />I am giving this device so far, a high recommendation- there is no way amazon is making a profit off this device.<br /><br />* this does not feel like a device solely designed to get you to shop on amazon or consume amazon digital media",B00TSUGXKE,B010BWYDYA,AHWDAYJUFF4AB5ZFAONXTHT2FVYA,36:41.0,24,TRUE,1343,3.8,5,4

After a few days of airing out, the bag was slightly less smelly but the whole living room now had the same odor.  I was able to reduce the bag odor about 60-70% by using one of those baking soda boxes with mesh sides (to remove odors from rooms).  But it's still not gone.

Yeah it flexes a lot, metal of the case is kind of flimsy. For me, it's fine. I don't expect to be moving this PC around hardly at all. But, I will say, I've seen cases that are plenty more expensive, same kind of metal in the construction.<br />- It's really kind of surprising just how small this case is, considering you **CAN** get 16 hard drives in and running. The product listing says 12. There's room for four more on the ""floor"" of the case. You need to have right-angle power and data cables, and be creative, but I have 16 drives up and running. No, the four on the floor are not screwed down. They only have 1/2 inch of wiggle room, so as long as you keep the case upright, they're not going far.<br />- Wow is this case tight in all the wrong places. I wish they'd made some additional openings in a couple of places for cables. Most of my troubles come from having 16 power and 16 data cables. Birds could nest in there and not need straw for the nest.<br /><br />Neither good nor bad (at least not yet):<br />- Running some file copying overnight tonight, with thermal logging going on. I only have the CPU fan, and one in the back and one in the front. The case does not have a top vent, nor does it have bottom intakes.<br />- Since this is an [apparently] older design/style case, with the PSU up top, instead of how things are usually done these days, with the PSU down at the bottom, There's some cable run advantages this way, but there's little room for a top vent.<br />- Not sure why, since the PSU is up top, there's no bottom intake. But stick a couple fans in the front and you should be good.<br /><br />Not a badly built case. Just economically done. Good price.

3,(Now Discontinued) Exceptional Android tablet in many ways - but beware of app incompatabilities - Android on Intel issue.,"Summary:  Discontinued model, won’t run all Android apps, no more security updates from Dell – but still has a number of fine qualities.<br /><br />Pros:<br />• Display = Spectacularly gorgeous, 2560 x 1600 OLED<br />• Build quality = High<br />• Networking performance = Superb speed, short range (stay near your wireless access point)<br />• Streaming experience = Excellent<br />• Heat dissipation = What heat? This runs cool<br />• Battery life = Long and efficient, once you tune settings and remove unwanted apps<br />• Ease of use = Ultra light weight, beautiful edge-to-edge display (tip:  I combine mine with a grippy third-party holder for ease of handling)<br /><br />Cons:<br />• Chip architecture runs most, but not all, Android apps.  (Only runs Android apps supported for Intel - but the prominent chip for Android apps is ARM, instead.)  If your favorite app is not supported, it’s probably going to be a deal-breaker for you.<br />• App compatibility can change as publishers add/remove Intel support from their new releases of Android apps.  (First-hand experience with this issue.) Do your own research – then live with (potentially changing) results.<br />• Discontinued model – no new Android versions, no more system security updates – though you can still update individual apps with newer releases, uninstall, and replace apps.  Dell discontinued its entire mobile product line in June 2016.<br /><br />Suggested use:  A fine secondary Android tablet for your home or travel use - if your apps are supported.  Won’t support apps written exclusively for dominant chip architecture for Android (ARM) - and as a discontinued series, there are no more system or security updates pushed by Dell.  Since future use is limited, I’d watch for a low price, before buying.<br /><br />My review here had a long history of changes since first authored in Feb 2015.  As a service to buyers, I’m paring it down to above summary only now, but you’ll detect in the comments history that it raised lots of useful discussion and even some controversy.  My rating for this model has changed radically in response to altered app compatibility and Dell's eventual discontinuance of its mobile line.  When my own favorite app received a mandatory publisher update which could no longer be run on an Intel chip, I ultimately bought a different, ARM-based Android tablet to replace this tablet, well before end of useful life should have occurred for this Dell model, so I felt genuinely burned as a consumer and reflected that into my review history as well.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you know and accept the limitations, this is still an amazing work of engineering.  Assuming you get a good unit, and at a low price, you’ll get some nice, if limited, use from it.  It’s still my own favorite tablet for travel use, for instance.",B00S7YFSK8,B00S7YFSK8,AGD3G2TVEHER6JE4JK5YWNM4QM5A,26:50.0,134,FALSE,2833,4.9,3,5

5,Fantastic pocket camera,"I purchased this camera for my wife as a birthday present. She previously had a Nikon Coolpix that had horrible problems with taking blurry pictures, and the battery compartment cover had broken off just from normal use. I have a Canon DSLR so we also like to have a compact point and shoot for when I don't feel like lugging the Canon around.<br /><br />I decided on the Sony WX9 after reading tons of reviews. Here are some features that we really like on this model after a few weeks of use:<br /><br />*LCD Screen: The LCD Screen is really beautiful. It is higher resolution than a lot of other competitive cameras and pictures and video look great.<br /><br />*Picture Quality: Most of the pictures have come out looking great. We really put this camera to the test by visiting Disneyland where she took about 600 pictures in two days. Photos in well lit outdoor environment look beautiful, with accurate colors and good crispness. Pictures from indoor but well lit environments also look great. We took a bunch of pictures in a restaurant with moderate lighting, and the camera compensates well without getting too grainy. Night shots have come out acceptable. Obviously point-and-shoots aren't going to have fantastic low light performance, but I think this model has probably the best low-light performance that I've seen in similar price range cameras.<br /><br />*iSweep Panorama: This is a great feature starting to pop up on a few cameras. It might be a little gimmicky for more professional photogs, but it has never been easier to make really great panorama shots without having to worry about manual stitching. Just push the shutter, sweep the camera, and you're done. You can take panoramas in landscape or portrait orientation.<br /><br />*1080p Video: The video coming from this camera is really fantastic. It's finally getting to the point where having separate photo and video cameras is no longer necessary for the average consumer. The video quality we got matches our dedicated camcorder purchased only a few years ago. Obviously it doesn't have the feature set and zoom capability of a camcorder, but the image quality is nearly the same.  We bought a 16GB PNY SD card which can hold about 4 hours of HD video. In addition, the image stabilization works great on the video. We used to have a Flip video camera which suffered from horrible shakiness when shooting by hand. The video from the WX9 is silky smooth.<br /><br />*Scene modes: We liked the different scene modes available. The blurred background mode that replicates the depth of field effect you get on a SLR camera worked fairly well and makes for great pictures. There's also a few very specific modes that seem a bit useless including ""Pet Mode"" and ""Food Mode"". We took some pictures of my parents dog with Pet Mode enabled and not enabled, and couldn't tell the difference, so not really sure what the point of it is.<br /><br />*Intelligent Auto: We used this the most because as you're walking around Disneyland taking a ton of photos it's tedious to keep having to change the scene mode. iAuto automatically decides what the best scene mode is (Landscape, Portrait, Backlit, etc.) and adjusts on the fly without you having to worry about it. It displays on the LCD screen which scene mode it's using which is cool as well. 95% of pictures taken using iAuto mode came out beautifully.<br /><br />Things we didn't like:<br /><br />*Battery life:  If you're using all of the features of this camera, especially video recording, the battery will suffer. As I said before the first field test for this camera was 2 days at Disneyland, where we took about 300 pictures per day. The stock battery got extremely low after about 150 pictures and some video recording. Her previous Nikon Coolpix could go a whole day (~300 pictures) on one charge. Luckily we purchased a Wasabi pack which included 2 extra batteries (Highly Recommended, just search for Wasabi batteries matching this model camera -- much cheaper than Sony batteries and last just as long -- also includes extra charger and car adapter).<br /><br />*Camera Interface: We both agree that the user interface for the camera is a little bit clunky. Can't really put a reason on why but navigating the menus just seems a little weird and slow. Not a huge negative, just something we noticed.<br /><br />*Unfortunately we could not sample the 3D capabilities because we do not have a 3D TV.<br /><br />All in all, we are very pleased with this purchase so far.",B004H8FNJY,B005QLG34U,AFRT7HUNPJTJWVP27IKOW25QUWQQ,41:24.0,4,FALSE,4503,3.7,5,4

2,Not UL-certified. No information on how this device works.,"This is not UL-certified or ETL-certified, which should make you nervous about using it. Surge protectors and power strips are more likely to start fires than to prevent them.<br /><br />This does not appear to be a typical surge protector, even though it is labeled as a surge protector. 140 Joules is far below what most surge protectors offer. Essential metrics are not listed, such as the clamping voltage and response time. There is no information regarding how this product works. Is this a MOV surge protector? If this is using some internal computer to determine if the voltage is out of a set range, the response time will be orders of magnitude slower than a typical surge protector.<br /><br />There is no insurance protection or guaranteed offered by the company. This brand is a Chinese company with no reputation. No additional information is found on the manufacturer’s Web site. The product manual is only online. Since too many product details are missing, and because it is not a certified electronic product, I don’t think anyone should use this.<br /><br />If your goal is to protect against nearby lightning strikes and neighborhood-wide surges, what you want is a whole-house surge protector. If you want protection from surges that are beyond that house boundary, look for a Series Mode surge protector, which is a patented technology and is only sold by ZeroSurge/Brickwall and SurgeX with Advanced Series Mode (ASM). If you are looking to protect expensive appliances, this is the next best bet after the whole-house protector. Next are the Metal-Oxide Varistor (MOV) surge protectors that most people are familiar with, which sacrifice MOVs to redirect excess current. The problem with these is they wear down over time, and the excess current is redirected back onto your house’s circuit where it can damage other equipment. The surge is not absorbed or stopped. These can be plugged into a Series Mode surge suppressor to avoid the negatives associated with MOVs, as the surge will have been stopped before reaching it. Good brands are Tripp Lite, APC, Panamax, and Furman. An example product is the $48 Tripp Lite Isobar 2, which offers a 1410-joule surge protection rating, is UL certified, offers $25,000 of insurance, and is a reputable US company.<br /><br />For a refrigerator, if your goal is to prevent it from rapidly turning off and on, maybe consider a battery backup, or devices like this product listing that provides a delay before turning back on. Modern refrigerator compressors might not need protection from that issue, as they are now controlled by complex circuit boards. In modern houses, appliances such as refrigerators and dishwashers might be on 20A dedicated circuits. My modern large $3500+ LG refrigerator only draws 3 amps, and the plug it has is a 15A style plug. It does not need a surge protector rated for 20A even though it is on a 20A circuit.",B0B4JB134X,B0B4JB134X,AH4Z47YBJ7FV42RHZBLKLGHH35CA,39:20.9,2,FALSE,2906,5,2,5

I was surprised by how small and light it is.  I decided to partition it into three sections: movies, data, and other multimedia. I couldn't get this drive to partition as delivered (NTFS), so I reformatted it as mac extended. (I wanted to try out the faster and more secure APFS format, but I read that it was designed for solid-state drives and was not the best option for external hard drives.)  Then I was able to format a 2T NTFS partition for movies, 2T NTFS for multimedia, and 1T in mac extended for data.  I labeled each partition with Blue-(some name) so that I could remember that they were all on the same drive.  It took me about 9 hours to transfer data to all three partitions.<br /><br />More importantly, let me share with you my external hard drive storage solution.

3,"Very weak wifi, but otherwise works well.","This is my first product purchase in the dashcam market so I have nothing to compare it to.  The dashcam works fine and it comes with a 32GB microSD card.  This records at 1080p and 2K resolutions, but recording at the highest quality video, the 32GB microSD cards is a bit small.  I upgraded to a 128GB microSD card and this is what I would recommend for recording at 2K resolutions.  This captures both video as your driving and the audio inside the car.  The Dashcam also has a very short ranged wifi network to connect, configure and watch the recordings.  This is where the device is lacking.  The Smartphone app connect to the wifi, buy literally only works when the phone is within 2-3 feet of the device.  It's even disconnected when I'm holding the phone within 6 inches of the device so it's a very weak wifi.  I recommend powering off the device, pulling the microSD card and watching the videos from there, or otherwise backing up or saving the videos off to a computer.",B072FVX74Q,B072FVX74Q,AFT4M5REMCNOLQNEZUVWW6EZSAMQ,01:43.3,1,TRUE,982,4.4,3,4

At times, it causes the camera automatically to switch off or it has to be taken out to cool down.<br />The annoying: the pins on the bottom of the buttons of the waterproof housing are ever so slightly too long, causing the GoPro to be turned on randomly as well as switching between settings, taking unintended pictures/videos etc. This is rather frustrating and annoying.<br />Overall, it is an okay product - performing as advertised, albeit with some side effects.",B074GWKWTF,B074GWKWTF,AGWTJHCMGL4AS2JDIDWFZDRSGLXQ,23:13.2,5,TRUE,845,4.3,3,4

Bottom line: shouldn't have expected much for $15.00, probably not worth the trouble to pay for postage and packaging to send it back for a refund.

Between the leveling, the brackets and spacers, to positioning on the wall, I doubt it takes more than 30 minutes for the average person.

The keys are easy to push with a tactile feedback. I also like the quick action keys for screen brightness, fast forward/reverse, play/pause, volume, on screen keyboard, etc. The screen position options are very convenient and the hinge is tight and seems to be sturdy. There are a few annoyances, however. The keyboard does not retain the backlight color or brightness setting after going to sleep. Also, it takes 3-4 seconds for it to wake up before you can begin typing. Again, these are only annoyances not show stoppers or reasons to dislike or not purchase this keyboard.

This is probably cheaper than most DIY solutions and it's very comfortable even on longer shoots.<br /><br />Some of the people who can actually afford the pro shoulder rigs out there are actually using this $24 one in conjunction with their rail system because the supports on this little guy are actually much more ergonomic than the ones that often come with the more expensive stuff. Go Figure.<br /><br />EDIT: 10 months later and I finally broke the extender piece. Seems like a combination of over tightening and pressing the camera down while using it order to gain stability broke the piece. I'm still able to use the remaining pieces to make something that works, but it's not ideal. I'm buying another one. Totally still worth it.<br /><br />Be aware, that because the front part of this shoulder mount rests on your chest, you will get some breathing movement in your shot.

It does magnetically click into place through the plastic, but it will not connect or charge. I have to take the case off in order to charge the pencil. Because of this, if you use the pencil, I do not recommend this case. I think the daily removal of the case may make it loosen up a bit, and it’s irritating to have to remove it for the pencil to charge. The plastic is too thick in that spot for charging to work.<br /><br />The case does feel a little flimsy and that right side tends to bend outward, not fully covering the edge of the iPad unless I am pushing it into place.

The extra ergonomic sport design with extra tips helps keep the buds in my ears. These are capable of going in my ear and staying in without having to insert the small bulb so far in my ear. Some other brands I have had to put them in so far to keep them to stay it was like inserting an ear plug, which muffles the sound and completely diminishes the quality. These stay in my ear without muffling. Great! The second thing is the distance. It says there is a 10 meter range and I think this is perfect for my needs. I tested them by walking around a two bedroom apartment with two floors, and I was able to hear the music everywhere I walked. Upstairs or downstairs through walls, doors, and the floor. Great!

4,"For the most part it’s good, but a few things could be easier - or better","While we wake up at different times, my wife and I are not fans of alarm clocks. We thought perhaps the sun rising kind would work. So far it is okay, but there are a few things that keep us from believing the Sunrise Alarm Clock, S6 White by LEMEGA, Wake-Up Light, Smart Alarm Clock deserves 5 stars. It is good, just not great. It is a large glow - this can work for or against you. We like the size for that - it’s not too big for us. But  the glow, while bright, is not disturbingly so. We are good with it. The reading of the number is only okay. We’d both prefer they’d be larger, brighter, and even “darker” in in tone. These feel a big too soft and therefore not a 5 star read. I’ll often have to look twice during the day - it’s not as bad at night. The one thing that’s frustrating is the hours - it reads in a 24 hour clock rather than the American traditional 12. We cannot figure out how to change it - we’ve read the instructions, looked at the product page, but we haven’t gotten it - yet. Maybe we will at some point. We prefer the 12 hours, but we’re dealing. Overall the instructions are not truly helpful and it is somewhat complicated to use as a result. It took a few tries to get it set right for the first time to use as an alarm clock. The sounds are alright, but we do not use them - we have a white noise machine we like - but at some point maybe we will. Overall it’s decent, and deserves the 4 star rating, but we cannot give it 5 stars as it is just that much off (complicated, the 24 hours) that it wouldn’t feel right.

The microphone comes with a foam microphone cover and a bag for storing or carrying the microphone. The microphone measures 5.25 inches long 2.75 inches tall and 1 inch wide. Just plug into the camera, turn the microphone on, and you can immediately use it. The sound was fine, though the microphone did clearly pick up background noise from about 50 feet behind me as well as my voice. All the functions seem to work, though I haven't yet tried to record anything far enough away to really tell the difference with the high-sensitivity option.

It's plain and boring, which has a certain appeal sometimes, but it also feels...cheap.  It's not cheaply made by any standard - mine looks as close to brand new as you can expect from a heavily-used backpack that's thrown around far more than it should have been.  Nothing has broken off, twisted, or even shows signs of distress.

The shoulder straps are a great shape and are comfortable.<br />The only knock on this bag is the limited ease to ""store"" the shoulder straps if you choose to carry it one-handed by the handle.  In that situation, the shoulder straps buckles have to be un-laced...  it would have been better if there was an extra buckle.<br />But the great advantage of this bag is how it carries as a backpack, so for me to complain that the shoulder straps don't store easily is a bit self-contradictory.<br />SUMMARY: excellent bag, very usable, and well made.  It is very much worth the price.",B000MN5XDE,B000MN5XDE,AFSMYE6Z47ISJ3FJWESMXVH2ZDUA,09:24.0,0,TRUE,886,3.3,5,3
5,"BT5, Comfortable & Clear. But No Dongle!","Overall, a nice & lightweight headset.<br /><br />Comfortable to wear with adjustable mic & ear piece. Uses Bluetooth 5 so this will help cut thru any lag or delay & it's also noise cancelling. The construction feels a little flimsy (lightweight plastic), but this helps towards keeping the unit light. Connectivity is pretty seamless (turn your BT scanning on, locate ""MX"" in available BT devices & connect). No pin required (at least on Android). Audio was clear & volume controls worked well. Mic produced clear audio as well.<br /><br />So what are the downsides?<br /><br />There's no Bluetooth dongle!<br /><br />To be fair, there's another version of this headset that includes a BT dongle for an extra $6 or $7. Not a deal breaker, but this option may be easily missed.<br /><br />If a BT dongle were included, then this would open up this unit to be used on a PC were it could really stretch its legs. And by PC, I mean a desktop unit that ""probably "" doesn't have integrated BT like a laptop would.<br /><br />So, outside of that concern, a good little BT headset overall.<br /><br />To the manufacturer: Perhaps consider selling only one model & including the BT dongle at a marginally increased price. This would cut down on confusion (you're selling 2 models now - 1 with the dongle & 1 without) & allow for this to be a very flexible package.",B09LCSKR12,B09LCSKR12,AELW7TMEO7INILU2GBIVI2CLGR3A,09:15.1,1,FALSE,1356,3.7,5,4
4,"Once Dialed In Will Produce An Excellent Image, But Not For Everyone","This is not your typical webcam! If you're looking for a simple webcam, then possibly look elsewhere. However, if you're looking for VERY high resolution VERY small camera, then keep reading.<br /><br />There is no light. There is no clip (to mount to a laptop display of flat panel). Heck, there's hardly a stand! The mic is usable, but not great. There is no on/off control (but there is a lens cap to at least cover the lens). There is no auto focus or any ability to control the camera remotely (IE: from your PC) outside of changing the resolution. And the focal ring feels pretty (very) cheap.<br /><br />The trade off? What you get instead is a very high quality 2160P @ 30FPS HD (Sony image sensor) camera mounted in a tiny 1.75""x1.75"" metal housing with a 3 meter USB (power & signal) cable.<br /><br />No bells. No whistles. No frills.<br /><br />To get the best results, you need to do the following:<br /><br />1) You need to have adequate lighting or the resolution will be GREATLY affected.<br />2) The lens need to be adjusted manually - meaning turned by hand - to get the best focus.<br />3) You CAN'T be plugged into a USB hub as the camera power is supplied from the USB controller. If you do this, them image quality will suffer greatly.<br />4) You will need to find some way to mount this thing. It has a supplied bracket & wall anchors.<br /><br />So, I think the manufacturer is intending this to be a permanent mount solution. Kind of set it & forget it. It doesn't have to be, but keep this in mind if your needs are portability. To me this feels less of a webcam & more of a compact (albeit featureless) USB security camera.<br /><br />The camera is plug & play (I tested under latest Windows 10 - Win 10 Pro 21H1). It was detected immediately with no drivers needed. I only used the Windows 10 camera app to test. There were no issues here at all.<br /><br />And once the camera was tuned, the image quality was exceptional.<br /><br />So, at slightly under $100.00 for a 2160P HD USB ""cam"", I don't think the price is off at all. And as noted, the image quality is amazing.<br /><br />However, from a user friendliness perspective, then you really want to consider your use case.<br /><br />If all you need is just a basic webcam for Zoom or Team calls, do you want to deal with all the nuance to get this guy dialed in each time you want to use it? Or, do you just want a clip on web cam that may not be as high resolution, but probably has more features & is easier to use?",B099PRC5PL,B099PQH8MY,AELW7TMEO7INILU2GBIVI2CLGR3A,38:46.9,2,FALSE,2504,4.7,4,5

4,Been using this with my mini-projector,"I had some issues with my flat screen tv - it is an older one, so not at all that surprising, but in the meantime, I didn't want to watch my shows on my laptop or even worse, my cell phone.  I have a small projector that I'd not used much, so I got it out along with the white silk ""screen"" I've used with it and set this stand up.  First, I had not realized how amazingly crisp my little projector has!  The screen I used is okay - it's not as opaque as  I would have liked, but it is a crisp, bright white screen.  It fit well on this stand  and I was able to move together two console tables together that are the same height so I had a place for the stand up off the floor.  That's one of the things I don't like about this stand - it expands from the top up, not from the bottom up!  What I mean is that the lower horizontal bar stays on bottom, near the legs.  Maybe that's to give it stability, but a third horizontal bar could have been added that moved up or down with the vertical poles.  The other thing that bothers me are the zip ties.  I would have preferred clips.  Large, plastic clips that can be reused over and over.

5,"I worked with scientists that studied life in U.S. waters (rivers, creeks, lakes, etc.)","Once a year these folks would have a science fair that really blew away the kids - seeing a bottle of water collected at a nearby stream and then showing the kids, with microscopes what lives in the water and identifying those ""critters"" so the kids understood what lives in water - it was so cool!  I don't have the smarts or discipline to be a scientist, but with this microscope I can introduce my grandchildren to the wonders of things not seen by the naked eye.  With my own children I had a second-hand regular microscope - one that wasn't very strong, but still, we had fun learning with it.  Now for the updated version of a microscope and this one truly is a great beginner's microscope to engage children in understanding the micro world around us.  Considering every child has a cell phone or tablet that can load the app, this is perfect for them - I mean, we can't seem to get kids to leave their phones/tablets alone, but with this microscope, they can be learning STEM educational material and that's not bad at all!  For the price, this is a very nice microscope.

5,Excellent bone conduction headphones,"I am not an audiophile, but I have pretty much every type of headphone one can have and each has their own pros and cons.  First, I do like earbuds, but I'm not sure what the issue is with my ears - not one pair of earbuds I've ever tried will stay in when I'm walking around.  I may have too short of an ear canal or something, but they end up falling out when I'm just walking around the house doing chores.  I love over the ear headphones with their clear, crisp sound, but after a short time, they need to be removed so sweat doesn't collect in that area.  I have another set that is my absolute favorite - they are ""over the ear"" in the fact that the small pads rest on top of my ears and are the most comfortable of all the more traditional earbuds/headphones.  Having said all that, I hope you understand that I have tried just about everything to find comfortable, useful, as well as excellent sound earbuds/headphones.  I did mention the pair of over the ear style that is my favorite, but bone conduction is a totally different type of sound conduction for people to ""hear"" their music, podcasts, audiobooks or whatever.  I absolutely LOVE this bone conduction headset.  I have another that is simply an MP3 style player - it cannot bluetooth to anything.  I loaded a lot of my MP3 music onto it and it does play well, but being that it is just my music loaded onto it, that limits it's usefulness to me.  This bone conduction set I had no trouble syncing to my Kindle and playing the audio books I have through Audible as well as playing my Amazon music.  The sound is great and I love that these don't tire my ears like other styles of earbuds/headphones do.  One of the best things with bone conduction is that your ears are ""free"" to hear what's going on around you.  I used to work in a warehouse where management stated we could not wear earbuds - I used my MP3 bone conduction headset and they allowed them since I could hear.  The same could be said of these - if you have such a waiver on earbuds at your work, these may be acceptable to wear at your work!  Excellent set for listening to your favorite tunes or books.",B09G6WWP1D,B09G6WWP1D,AGBG3KK74IKWJNQVMQAGVBWJ7FAQ,39:45.6,0,FALSE,2137,4.7,5,5
5,Works fine - much nicer than the headband I was using,"Yes, I have a headband that was marketed for listening to music (or audio files) while sleeping.  Okay, so the sleeping headband works, it is NOT comfortable when sleeping on your side.  The metal pieces inside the band are HARD and press into your ears.  Sleeping on my back with them on is okay...so I do have something to compare these earbuds to.  Granted, they are two different styles of audio devices - one is over the ear and one is in the ear, but the point is that both state they will be comfortable for side sleepers.  First, with these earbuds, the sound quality is good, much better than the sleeping headband.  Second, I can say that these are slightly more comfortable to wear with side sleeping.  Not completely comfortable - I mean, you have something hard in your ear canal and you are putting pressure on the side of your head when sleeping on your side.  Another issue may also be connected to the pillow you favor.  I personally have always used a goose down pillow because they squish easily but can be fluffed back out.  I chose my pillow because I'd tried so many others - memory foam both solid forms and shredded, the pile filler used in quilts and other items, somewhere along the way I believe I tried one that was similar to the bean bag filler.  So what I'm trying to say is that the pressure put on the side of your face with these earbuds in place might also have something of a contributing factor in the pillow you use regularly.  My down pillow gives more than others and I could be somewhat comfortable with these earbuds in, but I have to say I am not a fan of anything in/on my ear while on my side.  These earbuds feel much better when I'm sleeping on my back.  These are a fine set of earbuds and may, for some folks, work perfectly in the side sleeping mode.  For me, they will be used when I'm in a back sleeping mode.",B099RRM6S2,B099RRM6S2,AGBG3KK74IKWJNQVMQAGVBWJ7FAQ,22:31.5,0,FALSE,1861,4.6,5,5

My problem was what to do with all that time.  I had a couple of movies on my laptop, but I didn't want to run down the laptop's battery.  I have since stocked up on power banks, solar panels to recharge them, solar lights, and more, so this little storage device can have lots of pictures, but it's the space I have for movies that will keep this LAMU useful to me.

5,"Okay, I have some serious earbuds and over the ear headphones","Heck, I even have bone conduction style headphones, but I have to say that for the most part, I love this pair.  I used to have a pair of Sony ""clips"" that had this style of earphones that simply rest against the ear.  It depends on my mood and what I'm listening to as to what I prefer to wear.  I have some smart earbuds with a company app allowing me to do some tweaking, especially on the equalizer.  In ear is comfortable for about 4 hours on me.  Same with the over the ear style - after 4 hours my ears are sweating!  Bone conduction is the closest to compare with these, but there really isn't a way to compare them as bone conduction headphones don't actually interact with you ear!  They move sound through the bones just in front of your ear so you can still hear people in the room talking to you. But these, they are soft and don't squeeze against the ears, but simply lay on them without pressure.  The sound is good.  They may not be the amazing bass and soaring tenor of my expensive buds and head phones, but I can get comfortable and wash dishes, mop the floor and do other chores while wearing these and it feels as if I don't have them on.

5,"Picture quality is more to do with the projector, not the screen!","My first projector screen weighed a TON!  It had a thin metal frame around it that ""broke down"" so it could be stored, but jeez, I think it weighed somewhere near 40 pounds!  My next door neighbor would attach it to his second story back porch and the neighbors along his side yard could watch from their back yards.  The screen was larger than this one, but I have to say, this blow up one is great.  Easy to set up and so long as it is staked to the ground, it stays in place.  I have an awesome projector - it is an expensive one, though certainly not the most costly one out there, but with these projectors, you really do get what you pay for.  So, I live in a small mobile home park and talked to a few of the neighbors about a movie night on a nice, weekend night - set this screen up in the empty lot across from my place, the projector was set up in my yard and when it got dark, I set the movie from my phone to the projector.  The movie was a new original on HBO which I pay for but many of my neighbors don't have so they got to watch a movie much like going to the theater except making their own popcorn and opening cans of soda while sitting in lawn chairs where they felt comfortable.  It was a nice night and this screen worked perfectly as did my projector to provide a fun night at home.  I am hoping to roll up the screen from now on so it loses any of the original creases from being in the bag.  The rest of this - the frame and accessories can be put in the bag - I just don't want the screen's surface to show any creases which would distract from the movie...other than that, I love this screen for showing big screen movies.",B08BHZBSX2,B08BHZBSX2,AGBG3KK74IKWJNQVMQAGVBWJ7FAQ,23:50.9,1,FALSE,1650,4.8,5,5

The problem is, I have a speaker lightbulb that apparently is a sucker for an ""open bluetooth"" pairing which is how this one works as well.  Press the button on the adapter and it ""looks"" for available pairings meaning that my speaker lightbulb pairs with this adapter even though I don't want it to.  What I have found is that this one, like my other one, can pair with two items at the same time.  So if the stupid speaker bulb pairs with it, I hold the button until the second blue light flashes and usually that second prong will pair with the ear buds that I am trying to pair with it.  Just realize that is a short-coming of this type of adapter.  If you are on a plane trying to pair and having little success, try going in the bathroom with your adapter and the ear buds to ""contain"" the bluetooth and maybe that will help getting buds/adapter paired.",B082G38CRC,B082G38CRC,AGBG3KK74IKWJNQVMQAGVBWJ7FAQ,43:02.5,0,FALSE,1141,4.1,4,4

If I could afford to purchase Photoshop or Illustrator, they probably would work perfectly.

The spacial coverage this camera achieves, as well as the footage is very high quality. I haven’t mastered the 2-way audio feature yet, facial recognition and local storage, but it does have these capabilities. Basic set-up was fairly simple. I downloaded the app and set-up my account. You’re then given a QR code, which you place in front of the camera so it can read it, and then it does a basic set-up automatically. One confusing part of set-up was when the camera upgraded its firmware, and it acted like the camera was non-responsive until it finished upgrading (took about 5 minutes). After that, it worked perfectly. The unit itself is sturdy and much larger than other cameras we have of a similar design, but our other ones are more basic models. This Blue video camera is quite advanced and offers the best features of all of our cameras. I do think the unit itself is worth it, but it does seem a bit overpriced.

I don't believe these are true noise cancelling in terms of technology; seems to be just a tight fit of the ear canal that blocks out the noise.<br /><br />My major fault with these headphones are phone quality, particularly when there is wind.  They seem to pick up even moderate wind (i.e. when running or cycling) and transmits that to the person on the other end of the call.

That seems important as some others had problems if they did not do that.  I stuck the thumbnail size card into a Garmin, worked setting up hotels, airports, places we wanted to visit in Belgium, Holland, Germany, and France at my home here in America.<br /><br />When we got to Holland, just turned it on, changed location on where we were, and used it to drive all over the place as well as walking around different cities.  It seamlessly changes to kilometers.<br /><br />Some said theirs fell out of the unit.  I am not sure how as it inserts deep into unit and we had no problem.<br /><br />This purchase really enhanced our three-week visit to Europe.  We had no problems finding gas stations, restaurants, tourist attractions, avoiding traffic (it was perfect showing construction and traffic jams), or driving right to hotel in twisting and turning streets of old Europe.<br /><br />The only glitch was with the Garmin as I would recharge it at night and then when driving, it would drain the charge so it was almost dead when we got to Munich or some other city where we wanted to use it in walking mode.  I had purchased a battery unit that I just plugged into the Garmin when walking and that glitch went away.",B0055XNWJI,B0055XNWJI,AFP6GJLXY4QHS7MED3J5ECUA3FUQ,34:08.0,1,TRUE,1324,5,5,5
1,Never buying anything from RCA again,"This item was replacement for a DRC8300N that was also bad.  It took many months of fighting with RCA to get a replacement and I did not want this model as it also had problems on internet reports.

RCA won't answer calls or they put on hold and never return when they hear it is this model.  One nice lady said they have many reports of problems and can't fix them, then she hung up.<br /><br />I will never buy anything again from RCA.  I bought my original unit two years ago and had problems almost immediately.  Since then they have just jerked me around.<br /><br />To be fair, the unit was fantastic in all ways when it worked.

5,Works Great With Linux!,"This dock is just what I have been looking for to use with my Dell XPS 9560 with Linux Mint 20.3.  It does several things amazingly well.  First thing is you just have to plug it in.  It doesn't require any drivers like Windows does and it works as soon as you plug it in.  It finds all your drives, external drives, and the Ethernet port is fast.  The second plus is that USB 2 accessories work with it that won't work on USB 3.  I am left handed and use a Logitech left handed mouse.  It has an adapter that is about the size of a flash drive and had to be plugged into the USB 2 port or it would not work.  As this is a laptop that I use mostly as a laptop it was a pain having the stick poking out of the side of the laptop all the time.  Even with a right angle adapter it was a pain.  I actually wound up using a USB cable to move it closer to the mouse so it would work all the time.  The first thing I did was plug the mouse into the USB 2 plug on the dock and it works perfectly!  Actually, better than it ever did.  This makes me very happy!  The third is the Ethernet link.  I have very fast WiFi 6 but I prefer a wired connection and the one in the dock works just like you would expect it to at gigabyte speeds.  As for the rest of the dock and its ports - everything works just like it should with no problems.  I even have a powered 10 port USB 3 hub with several types of drives and accessories plugged into it and they all work.  Best part is that I have an 8.2 foot Thunderbolt cable (Trebleet on Amazon) between the laptop and the dock instead of the 18"" cable that came with the dock and it is just fine!  This dock is about $150 less than the Dell dock and does a whole lot more.  It is an excellent addition, works perfectly, and exceeds my expectations.  I am thrilled with it and highly recommend it.",B096V87F3D,B096V87F3D,AEBO7DV4BIAJYTJC6YNFSSJBSIPA,39:11.6,1,TRUE,1824,4.1,5,4

3,Gigastone 64GB SDXC memory card included in accessories will not work in this camera.,"The camera seems to work great.  But, do not waste money on this package deal.  Buy the camera, then purchase your accessories separately.  The Gigastone 64GB SDXC memory card did not work in the camera.  I got an error message &#34;INSERT SD CARD AGAIN&#34;.  There is little information in the owner's manual regarding the use of cards.  The manual mentioned that if you formatted the card in a PC, then you had to format it again in the camera.  But, I did not find any way to format it in the camera and the manual did not indicate how this is to be done.  The camera's memory filled up with only about 20 photos and that is certainly not adequate for any photo session.  All of the accessories are Gigastone and I hope that the filters, lenses, etc. will fit this camera.  If not, I wasted quite a bit of money on them.  I inserted a PNY Optima SDHC 4GB card and it worked just fine.  The owner's manual indicates that the camera should accept the 64GB  SDXC card, so I do not know if the card is defective or if the camera just does not accept any SDXC cards even though the manual says that it will.  So, now I have to purchase a card that will work for this camera. The battery charger and two batteries in the accessories are Gigastone also.  I am kinda leery of using the batteries since Panasonic states in their literature that batteries other than Panasonic might potentially explode.  The camera box itself comes with camera, a charger and a Panasonic professional battery, a wrist strap, a neck strap.  A memory card was not included in camera box.  I am disappointed with the accessories add-ons.  I do not know if the other products will work with this camera since I have not used anything other than the memory card. I would have thought that the accessories would be Panasonic compatible in a package deal.",B00MU3359S,B00MU3359S,AGLC4IMQ23NFVRVUXEMU5LKBG4XA,59:49.0,3,TRUE,1826,4.7,3,5

I have not hooked up an antenna to it, but it captures FM just fine as well.  The great thing about this is it uses hardware encoding, which doesn't tie up your processor for the task.

Easier Navigation and switching between apps.<br />2- Kindle has a more sensitive and receptive touchscreen, it seems that I have to push the screen several times sometimes for the Samsung to respond.<br />3- Samsung have a better App Store(Google) compared to the Amazon.<br />4- Samsung can have a SD drive added.<br />5- Samsung has back and Front Camera, Kindle just front.<br />6- Samsung has less memory(8GB, 4.5 usable), Kindle starts with 16GB.<br />7- Kindle processor is 1.2G while the Samsung is only 1GHz.<br />8- Samsung seems to get a little sluggish at times specially when opening several apps in a row where never had that issue with the kindle, maybe because the kindle will not allow apps to continue running in background after closing them.<br />9- Seems that the battery life is a little better with the Kindle.<br />10- Kindle does not come with a charger(Ridiculous!) and alot of complaints of ads while using Kindle.<br />11- Amazon customer service is superb, I don't think anyone beats them.<br />12- Samsung has GPS, not the kindle.<br />13- Kindle has hDMI output, not the Samsung.<br />14- Samsung measured usable Ram is around 700MB and not 1GB.<br />15- Same Price.<br />16- Amazon Video Library and access is great, Parental control is great. Don't think Samsung has a Parental control and still haven't used their video library and to see if u can download bought movies to watch later?!<br />17- Samsung options and settings are more versatile and editable for the experienced than the Kindle.<br />18- Battery life is worse for the Samsung compared to kindle, 6 hours on continuous use.<br />19- Samsung Tab Glass is NOT Gorrila Glass, Broke after a drop, Kindle took alot more beating and no scratch.<br /><br />So far, Seems the Kindle might have been a better option but not sure, I'll keep the Samsung for now and update this review as things change.",B007P4VOWC,B00BPO9HOA,AGBIXC23X7ZXU3TT4GRKQBQCNO6Q,43:39.0,6,FALSE,2307,4.8,4,5

Terrible!<br /><br />We practically bought a pallet of these when we upgraded our office and many people moved from two screens to three. Great value, hugely more crisp and bright than the nearly decade old flat panels they replaced. Lower eye strain, less glare. Greatly reduced power consumption. These run much cooler than our older monitors, and that translates to less HVAC load as well, for even greater savings.<br /><br />The greatest benefit has been the increased healthiness of the office in general. Headaches used to be a common thing, mostly banished now with modern monitors. Seriously folks, if your monitor is older, do yourself a favor and strongly consider replacing it even if it ""works"" fine. Cost can't be compared to health and happiness, but at these prices, there's no excuse.<br /><br />Long term durability yet to be determined, will report back though.<br /><br />Glad we bought, will buy again.",B00KWCD8D2,B00KWCD8D2,AGOLLSUQ3ZYZINNKSD37WXHKG4HQ,35:38.5,2,TRUE,1173,5,5,5

1,Not even close,"[[VIDEOID:36081bd4ae539ad6b67bbfe1684d4f49]] This adapter doesn’t even come close to meeting its specifications. I needed a 15 Volt at 1.75 Amp supply. The open circuit voltage up to 1200mA is around the 15 volts specified, but once you start loading it more, the voltage and available current drop quickly. I set my B&K 8500 DC load for 12 Volts which is the minimum voltage my circuit could use. At first I could get almost 2 Amps, but the output slowly dropped in constant voltage mode, and was down to about 1.75 Amps after 10 minutes. After 15 minutes, while still in constant voltage mode, the power supply actually shuts completely down every 3 seconds (see the video clip). When loaded to the rated 2 Amp output, the available voltage drops to just over 9 Volts, and the output (while it’s on) is as filthy as can be. The hash starts when the load hits about 1 Amp.<br /><br />If you only need 1200 milliAmps and don’t mind 800 mV of 25kHz switching noise and a short cord, this is your supply.<br /><br />Unfortunately I took too long to evaluate this, so I’m stuck with this piece of 💩.",B00MUE6JXQ,B00MUE6JXQ,AGGZPOVGLNMJFWXZKDKT5NHNLBDA,20:17.6,4,TRUE,1096,4.3,1,4
5,Good upgrade for a travel trailer,"This was a great upgrade for the sound system in my travel trailer. I recently replaced the stock stereo with an IRV34 unit (also a great, albeit very pricey upgrade), and hated the distorted, tinny sound from the crappy 15 year-old speakers. The major appeal of these was the shallow profile, and of course the specifications for the price. I bought two pairs to replace my four internal speakers and did an A/B test of one new pair versus one old. It was like watching a VHS video and a Blu-Ray side by side... I won’t say the Infinity’s sound is like angels singing, it didn’t knock me off my feet, but the music and lyrics come through clearly with a fair amount of bass. Bonus, they are loud and clear with the sound system at max volume, which with these speakers being 3 Ohms, is about 30 Watts per speaker.<br /><br />Installation was a breeze, though I’m not super-fond of the way the metal grills attach.

1,Not exactly what was advertised.,"This thing does not play .mp4 files at all.  Only uses what they call .avi, but it's some sort of non-standard .avi that requires you to use some Chinese-notated software that only runs on Windows, apparently...  When you upload a folder of .ogg music, it unpacks it and you loose the folder.  You can't load the SD-card with USB 3.0 and then plug it in because there's some sort of db indexing going on.  The FM radio works fine and I do like the stop-watch, but I want something that accepts and plays video's as well as music and this thing just doesn't load-up well...Comes with inadequate instructions and does not support very many file formats.  I did get music to work, but it isn't even compatible with .wav files..  .ogg, worked okay, but they're very thin files... I prefer other more rich formats.  Their support email-response was fairly fast, but I do prefer US-Based support for my products, with an 800 number to talk to a real person...  I would not recommend this .mp3 player.

3,Not very loud,"The good news is if you use these at work, you won't be in too much a danger of annoying your coworkers. Hooking these up and connecting them to a MP3 player resulted in barely any sound from the speakers.

On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being total silence and 10 being a rock concert - these are somewhere near a level of 4. These are 3.5 watt powered speakers which sort of explains it, but I would think they should be a bit louder.<br /><br />The speakers look good - bit of retro 90's style of tech - similar to the Logitech Z207 speakers. The speaker cones look to be paper based, I was sort of surprised they weren't a polymer based material.<br /><br />Overall I like the speakers, and the low powered sound levels are a bit of an advantage where I work.

3,Flawed construction,"Ok, I knew when I was buying these what I was probably going to get. I've purchased Pyle brand products/electronics before, and most times I've gotten functional items. This is one of those times that I didn't. The problem with the headphones I got is the cable got pinched where it enters the headphone. There is a slot in the base of the headphone where the wire is suppose to go into the shell. The wire on the pair I got apparently missed getting lined up in that slot and was pinched between the two pieces of plastic that makes up the earpiece. That's resulted in just one of the speakers working. I would return these for replacement, but I think I can fix it myself. Other than that I'm fairly satisfied with the headphones.- given the price I paid for them.<br /><br />The headphones came in a plastic bag with a cardboard hanger. One comment (not complaint) I might make, is that these are suppose to be sort of generic & universal headphones for most models of metal detectors. But the headphones have an 1/8&#34; phono plug, whereas both my metal detectors use 1/4&#34; phono plugs. I'm surprised you didn't get an adapter with these headphones.

I've taken my Kindle to work and everybody wanted to know where I got it. I think you can even get these covers for other tablets too. The one I got was the classic black.<br /><br />The cover is well made, the outer surface is sort of a rubberized vinyl and the inner is vinyl.

4,Sing Sour!,"I asked one specific question of the masses here before buying my 2nd gen dot, does it include an audio out cable? I received an answer right away, 'yes, it comes with a 3.5mm audio cable', excellent I thought, checked the length too short, needed RCA anyway so I ordered a longer one, all set! Well not quite, first of all it does NOT include any audio cable at all, not 3.5mm, not RCA, none! This seems to be a shift in the 2nd gen units as I know people that did receive the 3.5mm cable with their 1st gen device, seems like an easy cost cutter, I already had my new RCA cable so fine, no problem. Well not exactly, the thing about the audio out jack on these units that I still find no mention of anywhere is that once you connect the cable to the ECHO/DOT unit the internal speaker is cut off, silent, no audio at all. Which in hindsight makes sense from a build standpoint but is actually very impractical from a listening point of view. In my case I wanted to be able to play my music through my big speakers with subwoofers, and mids, tweeters and alike, but do not intend to leave the stereo receiver on 24/7 or want Alexa's voice booming at me. Well you cant have it both ways, if an audio cable is plugged into the device it creates an internal bypass of the main speaker, I guess they are all like this but nobody told me! In truth I didn't ask but as soon as I did it I knew why, so if you want the option of large audio output for music only first get the dual channel RCA cable, the 3.5mm cable is just silly, second you can get the same Monoprice quality (or better) RCA cable in a more usable 10'-25' length elsewhere for less, and third (last?) just leave it connected to your receiver and only plug in the ECHO/DOT end when your playing music or if you want Alexa to sound more like GOD is answering your questions!

It is extremely thin compared to the very early version.<br /><br />It's basically a mix between a tablet (in writing style) and an etch a sketch in that you can write and erase. You can write with your finger nail or use the stylus that is with it. The stylus is small but writes very smoothly. If you go slowly or waver, the writing gets a little shaky looking, so be smooth and confident in the strokes.<br /><br />The writer has two magnets on the back of it so it goes well on the fridge.

I immediately took it outside to test it out. I paired my phone with Bluetooth which is obviously simple. I was the able to use Alexa and my unlimited amazon music subscription to play whatever I wanted to hear. I tested music from several genres. I was highly impressed with this speaker. I was shocked with how good it actually sounds! I listened to my video, doesn’t even begin to do it justice. My husband tossed it into the pool and took a video. I’ll have him send it to me so I can add it to my review. It still played in the pool and played well when we took it out. We listened to it all night and even had a phone charging on it. Never lost battery life yet. Probably ran it for 7 hours straight and charged a phone and had the lights on and it never died. It’s extremely well constructed. The handle provides a great grip. So even if your hands are wet, you won’t drop it. And even if you do, it’s shock proof so you’re good! We will be tossing this in the Jeep and bringing it to the beach this weekend.

2,"So-so camera, terrible mount","The mount that came with my camera is a disaster.  It is just a matter of time before I go out my front door and find the camera in pieces laying on the ground.  The mount appears to be designed to snap into the round hole on the back of the camera body.  There are 3 very small tabs sticking out of the mount that are supposed to engage behind the plastic back cover on the camera body but these just don't have the holding power to keep this camera attached.  Pushing as hard as I dare without breaking the camera I can get the camera to ""click"" into the mount.  But the slightest tug and the camera just pops right off.  Who designed this?  I have it installed but as I noted, I suspect it won't last long.  Maybe I just got a bad one from an early batch.<br />As to the camera.  My front door has a covered entrance producing dark areas.  The sun areas are totally blown out such that you can only see giant balls of light with no ability to see any ones face or features.  My only choice was to point the camera down pretty much at the ground and hope someone passing decides to look up and smile so I can see their face.  I played around with video quality and other features but was unable to find a solution.  Maybe this is just operator error.<br />Glad I didn't take down my ring camera.  It has issues with sensitivity but at least the video is great regardless of the lighting (same porch so clearly something is amiss with the Blink).<br />I will give it a go for a few days and then I suspect it will be returned before my July return cut-off.

1,Product Doesn't Last (Good Noise Cancellation and Great Transparent Sound),"UPDATE 10/2021<br />I have had to change my review to a not recommended. Upon using these earbuds a little bit more they have really failed to live up to my initial hopes. The battery case WILL NOT hold a charge. After just three days in my backpack the battery case completely loses it's charge. I have several other sets of ear buds and this is not a problem for any of them. This is a huge issue and makes them almost useless.<br /><br />About a month after I wrote my first review I noticed the volume in my right ear was down. I thought it was me but then it got worse. I checked my hearing using another device and discovered that it wasn't my ears! Shortly after that the right drivers finally gave up the ghost and are distorted and almost not working. The right earbud is completely damaged and unusable.<br /><br />The ANC and user configurability are world class. Some of the features are really great. However, they are not durable nor is the battery life anywhere close to what was claimed. I cannot in good conscience recommend these.<br /><br />***** Original Review *****<br />SUMMARY<br />These are really great true wireless ear buds. The noise cancellation is really effective once you get the ear buds sealed properly. The included fit kit makes it easy to get a good fit without buying any other stuff. The sound quality is very clean and uncolored, something I prize as a working audio professional. The call quality is fine though the ANC does not work while making a call. Overall these are very nice ear buds that have great audio performance at a price slightly lower than the competition. These are also COVID mask friendly! Unlike headphones with a neck loop and wires, these sit fully in the ear and won't interfere with any mask. Win win!<br /><br />FULL REVIEW<br />Full disclosure, this is the first set of Bluetooth ear buds I have owned. However, I make a living as an audio engineer so I have been watching Bluetooth technology improve over the last few years. The fact that I am comfortable using Bluetooth interfaces from time to time in my work is why I decided to take the plunge and get a set of ear buds for my own personal use. Comments about sound quality will be based on my experience with professional equipment and reference tracks rather than comparing them to other consumer products.<br /><br />I was impressed that Panasonic was quick to fix issues with these that were pointed out in the customer reviews. For instance the blue blinking lights. For those that want to wear these in bed the blue LED was indeed very bright when it flashed. Within weeks of the complaints Panasonic had updated the app and pushed out firmware that allowed the lights to be turned off. I like that the company is paying attention to the product and making it better.<br /><br />They seem to sit pretty well inside my ears and don't look too bulky. They are big enough so folks know they are there but not so big that they look stupid. Unfortunately, I don't think these will stay in a runner's ears. They work for walking and hiking but not really for any other kinds of exercise.<br /><br />PACKAGING - A+<br />Unboxing these was fun! Much like opening an Apple product the item was packaged in easy to access layers. As I opened the package the first thing I saw was a sheet asking me to charge the case and earbuds. That was a nice touch because I was able to charge them while I ate breakfast and then play with them a bit before going to work. Included in the box is a paper copy of the manual, an ear fit kit, a USB-A to USB-C cable (thank you), the earbuds, and a travel/charge case.<br /><br />INSTALLATION - A+<br />I followed the manufacturers instructions within the app (more on that later) to hook these up to my phone. However, I believe that anyone that fancies themselves techie could connect to these with no instructions. Pulling them out of Inserting them into my ears was a little tricky the first time but I wiggled them into position just fine. Later I read that part of the manual and they have a great process for getting them seated in your ears. Use their procedure. It worked better than my first fumbling attempts.<br /><br />AUDIO PERFORMANCE - A+<br />I think the audio of these ear buds is really good. They aren't going to be the king of bass but they are remarkably flat and uncolored. Fit is super important in order to get the most audio quality. If you have any outside sound leaking in it will dramatically change how they sound. With ANC turned on and my favorite test track playing they were really good. I didn't apply any EQ to the track to compensate for the frequency response of the earbuds. I don't have anything to compare these to but I am giving them top marks for clean, transparent sound. The audio is going to sound just like the producer intended it.<br /><br />The app has some built in tone curves that are supposed to add bass or improve listening to vocal content. I could hear the applied tone but it was very subtle. My opinion is that the tone curves are currently not very useful. There was a user configurable EQ section but the EQ points were not very helpful. In general I think that the frequency response on these if flat enough that they don't really need too much tone shaping.<br /><br />If you are looking for monster bass, look somewhere else. However, these are full range and sound really good. Anyone who prizes uncolored sound and transparency will love these.<br /><br />CALL PERFORMANCE - A<br />I've been told that I sound just a tad less clear on these than using the phone itself. No one has ever complained about my call quality while I am using these. I noticed that the noise cancellation does not work when I am using these to make a call. However, since they completely fit into the ear there is a decent amount of isolation anyway. No real complaints in this department.<br /><br />APP - A<br />I was a little disappointed that I needed to install a companion app. However, it really makes it easy to configure the earbuds without pulling out a manual and going through a litany of button taps. I like that they kept the earbuds clean and simple and used the app for the more complicated configuring. It appears that you can link and manage multiple Panasonic audio devices within it. It also doesn't have to run all the time, just when you want to make changes. It isn't a glamourous app but it is streamlined and intuitive.<br /><br />This is also how you upgrade the firmware of the ear buds. It is a very simple process and the app makes it painless.<br /><br />BATTERY LIFE - A- (Turned out to be an F)<br />Battery life seems to be just as advertised on the box. However, the real surprise is that these drain down when not in use. I'm not sure if that is normal or not but it was a little frustrating to pull these out a few days after using them and find the ear buds and charging case completely dead. It would be nice if they didn't discharge quite so quickly when not in use. (Turned out this was a red flag. The battery case doesn't hold a charge even when the earbuds aren't used)<br /><br />FINAL THOUGHTS<br />Pairing for the first time is a breeze. However, trying to move to a new device can be very tricky. Only use the left earbud to put into device discovery mode since the right will just change ANC settings and not put it into pair mode. I would Probably turn all Bluetooth off other than what you want to pair to. It kept trying to link to my phone even when I didn't want to. If you turn the lights off you will need them back on for pairing duties or you will get hopelessly lost. Rock solid once paired though.<br /><br />I don't recommend setting these to auto power off. I did that once and they powered off. Since I was away from the charge case there was no way to turn them back on. For several hours that day they were useless! It would be nice to have a way to power the earbuds back on without having the charging case in my pocket. I would probably use the auto power off feature and manage the battery life more if I could do this.",B0863RPRRK,B0BSDMQ2T1,AFFQWI5LTKAHLNHLFEYJWHLHOTTQ,21:26.3,1,FALSE,8085,4.9,1,5

This cable, which is allegedly &#34;Apple MFI Certified&#34; worked for a few weeks (5 in my case), and then the Apple device rejected it.  Did their license expire?  Is this a ruse?  Planned obsolescence?  It's a horrible product and left me with a dying phone when I needed it for work.  At first it was fine, but just after it was TOO LATE TO RETURN, my iPhone told me that the device was not supported, and it would no longer charge.  I bought this with a certified car charger, which still works with an actual Apple cable (so far) after buying the 3-pack of extremely cheap cables, which either never worked or just did so for a short time.

5,One of the best GPSr's I have ever owned,"I have owned quite a few handheld GPSr's over the past 15 years. In total, about 20 units, 15 of which were Garmin's. I use them primarily for hiking and geocaching, and generally prefer durable, stand-alone GPSr's over a smartphone app.<br /><br />That said, I am quite impressed by the 62s. My previous unit was an Oregon 300 and I just recently traded it in for this one since I was not happy with the touchscreen. The 62s is a very solid device, with sturdy buttons, ample memory for maps, user-replaceable batteries (AAs), and a super sharp screen which is easy to see in daylight. The menus are laid out very well, and are intuitive enough for beginner users. This is one area Garmin has really improved over the years - adding the right shortcuts on screens where there weren't any on past models. The unit is also fully integrated with geocaching GPX files, so you can view caches, log attempts, view hints, and customize to your heart's content.<br /><br />The 62s comes with a high sensitivity receiver which not only finds your position quickly, but also maintains your position even when the sky is significantly blocked (e.g. thick forest, high walled canyons, etc.) By the time it has booted up, it will be ready to go (cold starts may take up to a minute though). Very impressive, especially when compared to the older Garmins from the early 2000s (i.e. original etrex). Track logging is accurate, and compass and altimeter features work very well for the price point. I do wish the compass needle updated faster as it did on the older models. Currently, it swings slowly, which makes it a bit more difficult when closing in on a geocache since you can overcorrect your target more easily.<br /><br />Overall, I am quite impressed with the 62s. It is the type of GPS I would be happy owning for the long-run. Very solid and durable design. I would highly recommend it to any geocaching and/or hiking enthusiast!<br /><br />+Solid design<br />+Robust menu system<br />+Geocaching features well integrated<br />+Good battery life<br />+Takes standard AA batteries!<br />+Fits well in the hand<br />+Strong antenna<br /><br />-Bearing pointer moves a bit too slow for my tastes",B003IHV6YG,B004I6CYXI,AHNP6DQG7ZUSRHUDETGRZKZJQKVA,18:31.0,4,TRUE,2189,4.6,5,5

4,Had to try it for 99 cents!,"Amazon had a brief sale where they offered these for 99 cents, so I can't complain too much. The only issues we've really had is the occasional flakiness of the signal between the plug and Alexa. Part of that is our fault because we have it connected to a switched plug that covers two outlets. We have two lights connected to the switched plugs, one of which has this outlet in it. We use the physical switch to turn on one of the lights and then use Alexa to turn on the other light if needed. Since it's in a switched outlet, sometimes it takes a bit longer to reconnect to the WiFi, causing Alexa not to be able to find it. That's probably more our fault, but we do have some flakiness on occasion even when the switch has been turned on for a long time.

5,Designed by readers for readers,"I love this thing! I have one in my purse, one in my kitchen for cookbooks and one in my bedroom for reading in bed (it can also hold books open on their side for easier reading while lying down - see Book Gem's website for details). I've also given away ~6 of them, as they make fabulous gifts for anyone who reads.<br /><br />I've tried 6-8 different book stands, and Book Gem is clearly the best one available, no contest. There is not a close second. This stand was clearly designed by someone who actually reads and actually uses a book stand.<br /><br />Fabulous features include:<br /><br />* It's small and therefore easy to keep with you. I keep one of mine in my (small) purse at all times.<br />* It's sturdy. The last 3 volumes of Harry Potter in hardback were right around the limit of the size and weight this can hold, but it held them.<br />* The arms have mighty springs which hold larger books securely open.<br />* Since the springs are mighty enough to hold larger books securely open, they take a little effort to open. The clearest evidence that this was designed by someone who would actually use it is the inclusion of little slots on the arms that hold 10-20 pages loosely so you can turn the pages with one hand without having to wrestle with the springs. Best book stand feature ever!<br />* It has a ridged slot in the fold out shelf that is perfectly positioned to place your thumb while you're opening the mighty springs, making it as easy as possible to do so. This is yet more evidence that it was designed by someone who actually uses it.<br />* It has effective non-slip rubber at exactly the places it turns out you want non-slip rubber: On the arms that hold the pages open, on the face where the cover of the book rests, and on the fold-out feet that keep it upright.<br />* It does not have non-slip where you don't want it: the slots where you keep the few pages you're actively reading / turning.<br /><br />I dine out alone often, so my most common use is in restaurants so I can read hands-free while eating. At least once a week someone will come up to me and ask about my book stand, and I eagerly show it off to them. That's happened so often that I've considered keeping some with me to sell on the spot! [Sadly, the packaging's too big to make that practical. :) ] In fact, one time the waitress was so interested in it that I left it for her as her tip! (Which I didn't mind doing since I'd just purchased 4 more to give as gifts and had an extra one.)<br /><br />If you can find a better book stand, A) buy it, and B) tell me about it so I can buy it!

My location is directly behind a large apartment building, but folks who live on either side of me get great reception.<br /><br />For years, I've used a antenna I made from coat hangers and wood blocks, and along with a high gain in-line amplifier I was able to get ok reception, but ...... I wondered if this Winegard Flatwave antenna might work better, so I gave it a shot.<br /><br />I was happy that the antenna cable was long enough to let me try out a LOT of different locations, and I found that once I had narrowed down the location to a specific area, that moving just an inch or two up/down or left/right could make a big difference.  In some spots I'd get every channel except one, then I'd move the antenna an inch or two and get that station, but lose another one, ha.<br /><br />Well, with patience, and lot of moving around, I finally found a spot that gets all my local channels perfectly, and it's been that way for a month, so I'd say this unit is doing the job it's supposed to do, it's much better than my old home made job.<br /><br />Over the air TV reception is a funny thing, and this might not work for some folks.  They might simply need to use an out door antenna.  However, if you have direct line of sight to the TV towers, then it's probably worth giving this unit a try.

Because this works so well, I have not used my heavy Nikon since I bought this converter.  Being able to buy a legendary 135mm  f2.8 AI Nikkor on eBay for $90 and use it like a 135mm ~f2.2 alone is worth the price.

5,A good but unremarkable bag that's a perfect starter bag,"You can do a lot worse than this bag, as while it does make some compromises to hit its price point (I've used plenty that cost 2x+ the price), it's a sturdy competent bag that I'd trust my gear in (there are plenty of poorly made bags that I wouldn't).  The size is a nice travel friendly one that will allow you to carry everything you need for an occasion (I've shot weddings using a bag this size with a couple bodies, flashes, and lenses), or even better for a trip (I've used this with a single SLR body, an extra lens, flash, and a point and shoot) combined with some non-camera doodads (laptop, power brick and gaming controller).  This is the sweetspot for me--enough for a week where you will use your camera but nothing too hard core.  The straps can accomodate all of the weight (many bags can hold much more gear than the straps were designed for), and the belt helps a bunch.  The size fits nicely in any overhead or underfoot scenario in even a commuter jet or prop plane.  In the field the bag can work in a pinch, but I'd say this is more for lugging gear than shooting out of.  I tend to pack a smaller sling in a suitcase that I use when I get to my destination while using this bag as a carry on to get there.<br /><br />In the end, it's hard to recommend.

All in all most drives are plenty fast enough for systems like the Xbox One where there are optimizations in the code to minimize delays for reading new data (as well as modest RAM, so there's not that much being read into memory for textures and whatnot.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a solid drive.

It has holes for screwing in a VGA cable, but I must confess I couldn't get it to thread. Unsure as to why, as I've never had an issue.

5,A simple yet rather useful adapter (no electronics--just a form factor change),"This is a relatively basic yet rather useful gizmo.  Basically it allows you to use SATA M.2 cards in a 3.5&#34; internal bay (like you use for a HD).  There's no controller or really any logic--just an adapter.  As such, even StarTech skeptics should be able to buy this without fear (note that various products are bundled in this review section, and I'm referring to the StarTech.com 4x M.2 Mounting Adapter for 3.5-Inch Drive Bay).<br /><br />The box was rather hefty, and in side was a well made adapter and all needed cables.  Depending on your situation, you may not need all 4 slots (or have that many free SATA connections), and you can use them as needed.  I found this useful as I'm replacing older Samsung 850 EVO m.2 drives using SATA with newer (and zippier) NVMe drives from Intel and Toshiba.  Thus my &#34;older&#34; (yet still darn fast drives) can still be used for other purposes in here.  Depending on your case, you may want or need heatsinks on your drives (they can throttle when hot) and they can fit in this enclosure.<br /><br />Do note that this is not a SATA controller, nor will it convert PCIe based drives to SATA.

5,Compact and speedy,"Sadly as laptops become thinner they are now forgoing the SD card slot.  My Dell XPS 12 falls into this boat, and the two USB slots are close together, making a dongle stile reader unpractical (blocks all USB ports and makes using power adapter tight).  Thus a SD reader with a modest cord and unobtrusive plug is the solution I looked for and found here.  The speed is quite brisk with my 90MB/s cards, and the ability to handle compact flash is a nice plus (haven't used).

5,Standing on the shoulder of giants,"I love my X-E2, but I was intrigued by the features offered by the X-T1 that built upon this already outstanding platform, thus I sold my D90 to add a X-T1 to my bag.  I couldn't be happier!<br /><br />While I like having a rangefinder format (of the X-E2), I'm partial to DSLRs, and here you get a robust, though somewhat compact SLR format.  Granted there's no mirror or optical viewfinder, but you really miss neither.  The autofocus feels a smidge faster than the X-E2 (with updated firmware), though that could be more of a false perception.  In either event, it's definitely good enough for most uses, even in a professional/semi pro setting.  Most uses excluding sports or fast action.  It's good, but not DSLR good.  The viewfinder is the best of both worlds.  While not literally offering both worlds (optical and electronic) of the X-pro, the large OLED is amazing.  While not perfect, it easily allows the innate advantages of an electronic viewfinder to eclipse the greatly reduced negatives (almost non-existent lag, great resolution, and contrasty images to allow for discerning examination of subjects).  The added ISO dial is a plus, though I'm still getting used to it.  What's hardest to quantify is the feel, build, and overall connection to the tool.  It's amazing.  The X-E2 gets most of this, but here it's so much more, albeit in subtle and additive ways.<br /><br />I'm somewhat indifferent on the tilt screen, as I find a swivel screen to be far more useful, but at times it helps.  Either way, it's a positive.  The rest (image quality, usability, wifi/app, etc... ) is outstanding.  Coming from the X-E2 I can take that as a given, but its all rather remarkable.  Some pros (especially those making a living doing landscapes) have concerns about the x-trans sensor and how it can lead to blotchy results (especially with 3rd party RAW software), but I find the sensor to be a positive in my work (largely portraits with some travel work as well).  YMMV.<br /><br />All in all, I love the camera.  It's got so much to offer, but it's a bit different than anything (save for another top mirrorless body).  Try it out before you buy, but be prepared to do so, as I think you'll fall in love.",B00HYAL88W,B00I15IE72,AECTQQX663PTF5UQ2RA5TUL3BXVQ,52:27.0,5,FALSE,2215,3.7,5,4
5,No need to pick either value or quality--you can have both!,"Note this review is for the 65&#34; VIZIO M652i-B2 model<br /><br />When I started looking for TVs to replace my trusty 65&#34; Panasonic plasma, I was initially saddened by the abandonment of plasma and the rich contrasty images I grew used to.  Having went from CRT to plasma, I didn't think anything without a phosphor would do.  I was wrong.  The best LCDs with local dimming LEDs lighting them can really deliver.  Typically this means a price tag close to twice this price, but Vizo has done their magic.  They've brought value to the high end display market, which is awesome!<br /><br />The unit is slim, unassuming, and even attractive in it's own way.  Being a 65&#34; model it's rather big, but it's surprisingly light and compact (as much as a 65&#34; TV can be).  I mounted it to the wall, but the stand seems nice enough. Like the stand, the speakers have seen minimal use with my home theater setup.  Setting it up was a breeze, though I wasn't terribly happy with it's initial settings, not that I've found most TVs to look good out (to my liking) of the box. While the menus could use some help, I was able to adjust the settings to my liking by starting with some recommendations and tweaking them a bit.  I was surprised with how well the blacks look.  Not as good as the best plasma, but hardly an issue.  Likewise the uniformity and off axis viewing is quite outstanding.  The only area where I really missed my plasma is with motion blurring as well as the means the set uses to address it.  You ever have blur or a soap opera effect.  It's a matter of preference, and I've yet to see a LCD that means my wants.  All in all it's not a big deal, and it's an amazing set for the price.<br /><br />I definitely enjoy this set, and I look forward to many years of enjoyment.",B00JL6532Y,B00CW6QESM,AECTQQX663PTF5UQ2RA5TUL3BXVQ,39:10.0,4,FALSE,1792,3.2,5,3
4,Smart features with sound compromises,"There is a sea of decent &#34;bridge&#34; cameras that offer more image quality than a phone (though honestly not much) or compact (all but eclipsed by cell phones) while offering a zoom that not only greatly eclipses the biggest of SLRs but also obliterates the magnifications offered by cell phones.  60x zoom!  How does this camera stand out?  A balance of &#34;smart&#34; features and sound compromises.<br /><br />As stated before you won't be blown away with the image quality, though if you're happy with your compact, cell phone, or current bridge camera, you won't be disappointed either.  It's solid and a step up, but you'll need a SLR or one of the new premium bridge cameras (Sony RX10 or Panasonic FZ1000) to really deliver outstanding image quality.  All in all this camera does a great job of balancing cost, size, and image quality.  The real genus comes in the details of the zoom lens.  While a 60x zoom is impressive, the fact that you start at a genuinely wide angle perspective opens up real possibilities.  No matter where you are in the zoom range, images are generally sharp, and there is decent contrast.  The built in image stabilizer and nice gripping surfaces allow for shake free images in most conditions.  The zoom and autofocus speed could definitely be faster, as they stand as the greatest limiting factors in catching shots, but neither is atypical for this type of camera.<br /><br />As for the smart features, Samsung has made great strides in mobile hardware, digital cameras, and most recently software and integration.  The work isn't done, but it's not half baked either.  The built in WiFi and smartphone connectivity does allow you to post pics to Instagram, Faceboox, etc...  More and more this type of functionality comes in handy, and this is coming from an old school film photographer.<br /><br />Beyond these specific areas, the rest if generally good.  Build quality is better than average for the class of camera, though quite a bit below a mid range SLR or a premium bridge camera,  Battery capacity is good, maybe even above average.  AAs would be a better solution given the cameras robust size and the general availability of them.  The integrated charger is a mixed bag.  You can charge with your smart phone charger, which is a plus, but there is no ability to charge the battery externally.  The screen and EVR are decent, though not remarkable.  Again a compromise to help hit the price point with the other features.<br /><br />All in all, I like this camera.  It's not as polished as a Panasonic FZ series (they've been making these types of cameras for a decade), but it's hardly a flawed camera.  I have no problem recommending this camera, though if you already have a bridge camera for the past couple years, this won't be a huge upgrade.",B00HV6KIEY,B00HV6KIEY,AECTQQX663PTF5UQ2RA5TUL3BXVQ,28:21.0,9,FALSE,2804,3.4,4,3

The room correction and modern wizardry is lacking in effectively (especially RC) and availability (scaling, DLNA, etc...).  I just couldn't get it to work anywhere near right in a basic room.  Worst of all, the reliability isn't quite there.  It does shutdown on occasion,<br /><br />All things considered, it's a solid receiver, but it's in a world of great receivers.

5,Best slim iPod case I've seen,"There are many iPod Touch cases out there falling into many different types of cases.

In addition, it makes the iPod easier to grip, and keep things slim enough to retain the iPods svelte proportions.  As an added bonus, this case doesn't attract lint or preclude the use of sleeves with some of the stickiness that silicone cases may possess.  All in all it's everything I wanted, and unlike some other cases I've tried, this one fits snugly (no sliding within the case), allows full use of the dock connector (including in my [[ASIN:B004G5ZA5K APPLE UNIVERSAL DOCK-USA (NEWEST VERSION)]]and my [[ASIN:B004FPYL56 Iomega SuperHero Backup and Charger for iPhone]]), and buttons are easy to use.",B0042BBHMS,B0042BBHMS,AECTQQX663PTF5UQ2RA5TUL3BXVQ,59:41.0,0,TRUE,885,4.8,5,5
5,"Awesome speaker, phenominal value","BIC America makes many high quality speakers for affordable prices, but this could be the best value of the bunch.  While not a part of the slightly higher end Acoustech series (for example this slightly larger [[ASIN:B001VIPUFU BIC Acoustech PL-28 Center Speaker - Black]]), this speaker shares many of the components you'll see there (more than other BIC America speakers).  These welcome upgrades include a horn loaded tweeter similar to what one finds on Klipsch speakers (supposedly BIC was forced to forgo their orange drivers in favor of the new platinum ones on Acoustech speakers as they looked too much like Klipsch's reference series), attractive cabinets, broad range (40Hz-23kHz), and high levels of sensitivity (95dB).  One bonus this speaker adds over the similar Acoustechs is the ability to mount the speaker vertically on a wall (thus allowing it to operate more easily as a left or right speaker).  The included wall mounts work very well, which they need to, as this is a hefty speaker (16lbs).<br /><br />Look around for a similarly priced speaker that offers most of these features, and you'll start running out of luck. Try finding them all, and you'll either be looking at a 2nd hand Klipsch (if you're lucky) or this one.  Others may seem similar, but lack the sensitivity (require more wattage for a given level of sound) or the range (you won't need to rely as much on a sub as with other speakers).

3,Not what I expected,"I went shopping looking for the Garmin Nuvi 265T or 265WT, and instead brought home the Magellan Roadmate 1475T because it had an instant rebate and the features were comparable to the Garmin. I read some quick reviews when I got home and there were mostly very positive reviews about the 1470 model, and I quickly found out the 1475T is the 1470 but with the optional traffic receiver already included in the box so you don't have to buy it separately.  I was excited that this was a great buy and took it out for a test run.<br />The first time I used it, on my way home, it totally bypassed my house and took me nowhere near my house.  I was curious where it was going to take me but gave up and decided to just go towards my house because it was late. But I did stop and re-entered my home address, but this time included the hyphen (dash) mark between two numbers and it did end up taking me to my house.  The hyphen is optional though, and I thought that since there isn't any other possible address in my zip code with the same street numbers it should of known this.  Oh well, I thought no big deal, I just have to remember to include hyphens.<br />The next day I was in another town and decided to go to a local Lowe's Home Improvment Store.  I searched the POI's and could not find one. I searched by name and category and couldn't find one.  Then I tried searching for ""LOW' because I might be spelling it wrong but still no luck.  After much fiddling, I finally typed ""LOWE'S"", and included the apostrophe (') between the E & S and finally got multiple locations to choose from.  At that point I was thinking that this device requires you to be precise with your searches or you won't find anything.  I'm not a genius and sometimes I won't know the exact spelling of a POI, so I'll be screwed when that happens. Heck it didn't even have a Lowe's listing under it's ""home improvement"" category, and there was one literally 2 miles from my location.<br />Another thing that irks me is that it always tells you your destination is on the wrong side of the street.  All three times that I arrived home it told me my house was on the opposite side of the street, and I tried arriving from both sides of the street, and it always told me the opposite side.  This also happened when I arrived at somebody else's house in another town.  This would be a big deal if my destination was on a wide, busy, two-way street and I'm looking one way for my destination and end up passing it because it's on the other side!<br />Another negative, and this is well documented in other 1470 reviews, is the location of the USB port on the device.  It's too close to the mounting bracket and the cable part that attaches to it is ""L"" shaped, so it's impossible to plug in the unit and then mount it. You have to mount it, THEN plug it in.  But then your doing this blind because you don't have a clear view of the USB port when it's already mounted.  This is annoying,and requires lots of fumbling when your setting up.  However you can work around this by mounting it on the suction cup before you attach the suction cup to the windshield, then plugging it in, then attaching both to the windshield.  At first I thought I was doing something wrong, then finally realized that this is clearly a design flaw.<br />Another flaw - Lane Assist feature.  This is a great feature when it works, but once it told me the exit is on the left when it actually was on the right.  The device also depicted the exit to be on the right, but the voice kept saying it's on the left.  In unfamiliar territory, and when you're not looking and just listening to your device (like you should be doing most of the time), this can cause you to miss your exit!<br />There was one thing this device did very well - avoid a traffic jam.  It alerted me of upcoming traffic on an expressway.  I told it to avoid this traffic, so it took me off the expressway and guided me to another expressway that runs parallel to the other one.  I got off the expressway just when traffic was slowing down, and I knew there really was a delay because the electronic traffic sign on the expressway confirmed it.  I got home in no time thanks to the device.  This was one of the primary reasons I wanted a GPS.  I live and drive in the NYC and Long Island area and think this feature is a necessity if you have a GPS.  That's why I was originally looking for the Garmin Nuvi 265T, because it has lifetime free traffic, and so does the 1475T.<br /><br />I really wanted to love this device.  The screen is big and beautiful.  The One Touch interface is convenient. The AAA guide is useful.  The maps and routing are easy to use.  The Magellan ""chime"" right before a turn is appreciated.  The price is right - lower than other devices with comparable features. But I can't get past the deficiencies, especially since they seem so basic.  And after reading all the horror stories about Magellan's customer service I'm afraid of what will happen if I ever need the device serviced.  I have another 28 days to return this device for a refund, which I will do way before that.  I'll probably spend the extra $70 and get the Garmin Nuvi 265WT.  I've only heard positive things about the device and the company.",B00281FXFQ,B00XIWWSRK,AGLX563D3LDSH5D2NEOLS5P4XPVQ,58:16.0,36,FALSE,5251,4,3,4

3,HP TouchPad 32 GB - Don't buy for more than $200,"August 2012<br /><br />I still like my Touchpad but I would not pay $200 for this product.  The browser is not compatible with many sites and there are few sites.  It is thicker than newer tablets and has less power.  There is a version of Android Ice Cream Sandwich being developed for the Touchpad.  The Android version is still in Alpha.  I think you would better buying ASUS TF or TFT or Nexus 7.<br /><br />December 2012<br /><br />I have really enjoyed the Touchpad over the last six months and I am still happy I bought it.  But, there a lack of Apps are begining to detract from its appeal.  I cannot tether it.  Also, I cannot use Yahoo messenger.  In GMAIL I can only access a limited portion of history<br /><br />-I have had the HP Touchpad for a few months now and I still love it.  I wanted to update that WebOS (the great operating system on the Touchpad and much better than Android) is now open source software.  Hopefully, that means more Apps and a long life of an improving operating system.  Too bad Android is so popular.  Web OS is much better.  I highly recommend Picsel Smart Office (Word, Powerpoint, Excel) as an app.  It has drawbacks but it is really much better than Quickoffice (comes with the Touchpad.) I bought an HP keyboard.  It is light and makes typing very easy.<br /><br />The following review was written after having the Touchpad for a couple of weeks.  The bottom line is that for $270 this 32 GB HP Touchpad is a joy. Ideally one would compare tablets to each other but I have only played with the IPAD 2 for a few hours.  Like the HP TouchPad tablets are wonderful because they are: lightweight (1.6 pounds), great screen, and boot fast.  I think the TouchPad is as good as anything out there and it is less than half the price.<br /><br />I will start with the negatives:<br /><br />First CNET criticizes the HP TouchPad because it feel like plastic, finger smudges get all over the black case and it is thick.  It does get smudges but they are on the screen too and all tablets are going to get that because of the technology of touch screen.  I wouldn't have noticed the smudges on the back had not some CNET reviewer complained (there are smudges).  I don't look at the back of the TouchPad often and they are easy to wipe just like the smudges on the screen.  Finallyi, the TouchPad isn't that much thicker then the IPAD.<br /><br />Second negative: Limited Apps: This is probably a valid concern but I have all of the Apps I want.  Kindle, weather, tape recorder, file manager, word processor, power point, spreadsheet, Facebook, note organizer, etc  would like to have a good dictionary for a more reasonable price.  Also, there is a community developing an Android system for Touchpad and my son is going to show me how to set it up so I can dual boot and use Linux Apps if I ever need them.  Bottom line, the limited Apps is probably only a problem if you want lots of games.  There is an App that allows you to access your computer over the internet and run software on your computer.  You can even watch Netflix.  It cost $10.  I have not tried it but the reviews are great.<br /><br />Third negative:  This is somewhat related to the second - concern about long term support for WebOS. It isn't clear what HP will do with Web OS but there are a lot of programmers who love the operating system so I am optimistic and there probably will be the option to run Android at sometime in the future.  By the time the operating system is outdated, if ever, technology improvements will have made all of the existing tablets obsolete and you will save $330 buying the TouchPad.<br /><br />The positives:<br /><br />The price.  I paid $270 for a 32 GB version and I think it is a good, maybe better as IPAD or Android versions.  It isn't as beautiful as the IPAD and may have less Apps but for $330 savings I will take the HP. If I am going to spend $600 I will look at Ultra light portables.<br /><br />User Interface:  Is wonderful, uses ""cards"" for Apps, you can have lots of Apps open at the same time and move easily between them.  It is fun to use.<br /><br />Is supported by a user community that loves the fact that you can easily change it, run other operating systems etc.<br /><br />You get 50 GB of storage in the cloud for free.  You can share certain folders to let others access files and/or edit them.  I have used it to provide samples of work to prospective clients.  It has been really useful.<br /><br />The email is great. I access all of my accounts under one email.<br /><br />I enjoy the easy access to apps, web, reading, email, word processing.  It is light, easy to carry around, the battery life is great.<br /><br />A few comments about Tablets.  I do a lot of work on spreadsheets and I think all tablets are limited because they do not have enough memory to handle large spreadsheets.  Also, typing is awkward.  It was awkward on the IPA as well.  I am going to buy a keyboard.  I bought a cheap leather case for less then $10.  I wished I had spent more money.  Buy one that will support the screen in vertical position so you can type of a keyboard.",B0055D66V4,B0055D66V4,AHBDHPOIJFLKU7ZGQB2UTXQGI4TQ,34:20.0,6,TRUE,5129,4.4,3,4

5,Strong machine with minimal bugs,"I'll start this review pointing out that this Chromebook had some operating system bugs back when it first arrived in January 2013. Over the first two months and many automatic updates later, I have a smooth operating, 6+ hour battery life, fantastic machine.<br /><br />The gap between Chromebooks and traditional mac/pc's is slimmer than many people make it out to be. Yes this machine cannot do much offline aside from watching previously downloaded video on the 15 gb drive or using the google editing suite as long as it is installed (docs, presentations, spreadsheets). Comparing what most people use their mac/pc's for when internet is not available, the typical user will have similar if not identical useability.<br /><br />My biggest highlight of this machine is the stability of the Chrome operating system. Malware, viruses, and other problems that bog down pc's (and mac's to a lesser degree) don't do a single blessed thing to performance of my Chromebook. I'll make a guess this is thanks to the unique cloud software setup from Google that keeps viruses at bay, and performance at a high and stable level.<br /><br />For $250, you will not find a comparable computer with performance or parts that can keep up. The 6+ hour battery keeps me up and working (or playing :p) much longer than I had before. This chromebook is a great jumping point as a second computer for the traveling professional, or even a primary machine for the typical internet browsing person.<br /><br />What this is for:<br />- web browsing<br />- word editing (through google docs)<br />- use of web applications<br />- online video up to 720p (1080p works but I notice that the frame rate per second is a little slow for my liking)<br /><br />What this is NOT for:<br />- complex data editing (excel, access, other database software that is not available)<br />- photo editing (again, not isntallable software)<br />- games that require high amounts of RAM and CPU power",B009LL9VDG,B009T3EYHO,AHBVYC2INFKS5Y5V5K5UNIWQIZBA,55:58.0,4,TRUE,1960,5,5,5

5,The best surge protector for multiple fat adapters - the rotating side outlets actually work with no bulk,"After trying at least 6 different types of multi-outlet surge protectors, I have settled on this model as my go-to model.  This is the only model I've found for which the 'fit multiple large adapters' design really works.<br /><br />- It has a high joule surge rating<br /><br />- It's not loaded with a bunch of extra writing and lines and buttons and hoo-haws - just a simple red on/off switch, and compact ethernet and coax connections<br /><br />- The unit has just the right size and heft - it is not too bulky, and it's easy to slide around and pick up with one hand<br /><br />- packed with outlets for such a small size<br /><br />- Most of all - out of all the surge protectors I've purchased and tried - the rotating outlets REALLY WORK.  No gimmick.  I have packed the thing full of thick adapters.  Just rotate the plug and you can easily fit one fat adapter after another in a row along the sides, which coincidentally still leaves the row on the top, flat side available and open for more frequently hand-pulled simple cords - and it's just the flat side you have easier access to when you want to pull cords in and out by hand, so you can easily plant one hand onto the surface while you pull out the cord straight up into the air without risk of the thing coming off the ground or yanking around because you're trying to pull a cord out or push it in from the side where you have no leverage and can't see.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

5,"Works well, but understand why you would or wouldn't need a voltage converter","First, let me clear up some misperceptions that I see being posted here:<br /><br />Smart phones, tablets, laptops, and even battery chargers for digital cameras do not require a voltage converter. All you need is an adapter to plug into a foreign outlet (and it's becoming pretty common for hotels and airports to have universal outlets).<br /><br />There are few electronic devices that you are likely to travel with that require a voltage converter — and some like a hair drier should not be used with the BESTEK converter.<br /><br />What I use the converter for is my electric toothbrush which will not work with 220-240. There are universal charging bases, but I was having a hard time ordering one so I just went with this.<br /><br />I've used the BESTEK on multi-week trips all over the world to keep my toothbrush charged. Never had any problems.",B012ERZ7B8,B07KKMWWXB,AFCCY6D7QLYO3SVKCVFPYUXL6HPA,27:07.0,660,TRUE,856,4.2,5,4
4,To be clear: It's an access point not a repeater,"What this product does is take your WiFi signal and rebroadcast it as a new network. So if your WiFi network name is MyHomeNetwork, when it comes out of the Amped it's name is MyHomeNetwork_RE (or whatever you want it to be called). That means when you're out of range from your router (MyHomeNetwork) you have to manually switch to the Amped (MyHomeNetwork_RE).<br /><br />So, this is not a repeater which *just* rebroadcasts the signal from your router. The Amped is essentially an access point.<br /><br />As a result, the Amped is best for stationary devices, such as if you have a computer or streaming box on the other side of your house that's too far away from your router. If you're hoping to use it with a mobile device it's going to be annoying because there's no way to have them automatically switch between the two networks, flipping to the one that's strongest -- you're going to have to toggle between them manually. Also keep in mind that which ever network your phone or tablet first detects when you enter your home is the one it's going to automatically connect to and remain on. So if MyHomeNetwork is the one that gets detected first but you spend most of your time in the part of the house where MyHomeNetwork_RE is, unless MyHomeNetwork's signal completely dies you'll automatically remain on it.<br /><br />(Another potential use is if you're in an apartment building and want to split your internet with the person next door -- could be a good way to save money).<br /><br />SETUP: It's is super easy and can be done entirely wirelessly.<br /><br />There's an LED light on it that indicates if you've placed it too far from your router.<br /><br />If your router puts out both 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz networks the Amped will rebroadcast both. As noted before, the new networks can be called whatever you like and have unique passwords.<br /><br />It has some other bells and whistles, such as setting security permissions for who can access it, adjust its strength, and even turning it on and off on a preset schedule. I could see these features being useful if you're a cafe owner, for example, and want to provide you customers with free WiFi, but don't want people outside of the cafe being able to access your internet and/or not wanting it available after hours.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE: I tested this in a single-story home where my download speed is approximately 65 Mbps. When I walk two rooms over from my router -- 30 feet away -- the download speed drops to 15 Mbps on my iPhone 6. When I walk through one more room and go outside -- an additional 15 feet -- the download goes to zero.<br /><br />I placed the Amped at the 30 foot mark. Standing next to it I get about 58 Mbps download on my iPhone. I can go outside about 30 feet before the download goes to zero.<br /><br />Overall I'm impressed with the ease of setup and the performance.<br /><br />WHY I TAKE OFF A STARR:<br /><br />At the time of this review the Amazon was selling the Amped for $159. That's a ridiculous price. There's no shortage of online tutorials showing how to convert an old router into access point that will do the basics of the Amped -- rebroadcast your router's signal as a new network name but without any afore mentioned the bells and whistles. So you can save yourself a lot of money by using an old router lying around your house or buying one used for a few dollars. Given the additional features and ease of setup I'd say a more reasonable price would be $50.",B00TKFDYIQ,B01NA7RS1X,AFCCY6D7QLYO3SVKCVFPYUXL6HPA,37:33.0,8,FALSE,3479,5,4,5
4,Better sound than you'll ever get from your TV but pricey,"I'm going to review this product through the lens of its intended use: a space saving speaker. I say that because it's not meant to deliver audiophile sound, but provide better sound than you'll get from your TV speakers without taking up much space (and I say that as someone who owns a 5.1 surround sound system with floor standing speakers).<br /><br />Size: Assuming that your TV is elevated about an inch or so by its stand and that the rim around the screen is also an inch or two,  The mono speaker is short enough that if placed in front of your TV it should not block the screen. But you should still measure everything before buying.<br /><br />Sound: Not surprisingly it's a big step up from the speakers on your TV. I tested it on a mix of TV shows with lots of dialogue, music competition shows, and movies. Sound was warm and crisp, with good bass response from the woofer. Simply put, it's results in a much more pleasurable viewing experience than you'll ever get with TV seekers.<br /><br />For fun I compared it to my 5.1 system -- perhaps not a fair comparison, but this is a pretty pricy speaker system. The center channel in my system provides a much more spacious sound with more bloom. It also helps that the center speaker is substantially larger than the Bose.<br /><br />Bose includes a universal remote that can be programmed to control all of your other boxes: cable, Blu-ray, etc.<br /><br />I also have to give Bose credit for including all of the connecting wires you may need, such as the optical cable for connection the speaker to your TV (it's amazing how most Blu-ray players do not ship with an HDMI cable).<br /><br />My one criticism is that Bose uses a proprietary cable of their own making to connect the woofer to the speaker, preventing your from buying a third party cable if you want to place the woofer farther from the TV than the included cable will allow. In fairness the speaker cable is 10' long, but take that into account before buying in case you do plan on placing the woofer way off to the side.<br /><br />I'm taking a star off for that, as well as the fact that I feel it's slightly over priced (at the time of this review Amazon is selling it for 600 dollars).",B00N1SSWXU,B00N1SSWXU,AFCCY6D7QLYO3SVKCVFPYUXL6HPA,33:12.0,197,FALSE,2219,4,4,4
5,Studies show WD drives have longer lives than the competition,"As others have noted, external hard drives claiming to be for Windows or OS X is all marketing -- any hard drive can be reformatted for the file format each operating system uses. Even though I'm a Mac users, the only reason that I bought this version of the WD My Book was because  at the time of purchase it was cheaper than the Windows version.<br /><br />Why did I choose a Western Digital hard drive? Backblaze recently released a study of 27,134 consumer-grade drives it uses for its backup data service which found that Western Digital drives had longer lives than Hitachi and Seagate by a pretty good margin. And as a very long time user of Lacie, I've found that their quality has slipped.<br /><br />WD sticks a bunch of backup software on their drives, which too is all marketing. All Macs come with a very powerful and free backup program, Time Machine -- that's what you should be using (the first thing I did was reformat the drive to remove all of that pre-loaded crap). Having had to restore from it after a hard drive failure, I can personally attest to its excellence. If you need to backup an external drive to another drive -- such as a drive you keep all of your photos on -- use a program like Carbon Copy Cloner.",B00E6N9HEC,B00E6N9HEC,AFCCY6D7QLYO3SVKCVFPYUXL6HPA,30:53.0,8,TRUE,1235,4.4,5,4

Usually very Blue or Green. Adding the pink filter made my footage better, and easier to work with.<br /><br />The reason for the 4/5 stars is that these filters are resin (plastic), and are prone to scratch easier than a glass filter would. Generally not a big deal, but if you shoot straight into the sun you will get weird color fringes and artifacts from any scratches (or dirt) on the filters. Also I wish there was a carrying case, or a better way to protect the filters between uses. The filters come in his soft plastic pouches, but they fall apart pretty quickly.

3,Good Camera not Great,"As an owner of the 2 megapixel Sony DSC-S50 I was a little disappointed with the DSC-P10.  First of all it's missing the ability to shoot B&W photos.  Although you can edit your photos with basic photo software later, you no longer have the ability to view and shoot B&W photos.  Another feature greatly missed is the 2"" swivel LCD display.  This allowed you to hold your camera over your head, out over a ledge or lower than eye level without you having to get in those positions to take a picture.  Most disappointing, though is the slow response time.  Being new to the 5 megapixel realm, this may be common.  But taking one picture to the next, especially when using a flash, can take up to 7 seconds.  A cool new feature is Burst mode, which allows you to take 3 photos in a little over a second.  But again going from one set of three to the next takes a whopping 9 seconds.<br />Now for the good stuff.  Being an ""advanced"" point-and-shoot user, I like the ease of use along with the more advanced controls the DSC-P10 gives you in taking photos.  I'm learning how to use the histogram to get desired lighting effects.  The menus are fairly easy to learn and navigate and the compact size makes it easy to carry.  The Burst mode, mentioned earlier, is a cool feature.  And, as was with the case of the DSC-S50, I'm very satisfied with the sharp picture quality.  A great improvement in the Movie mode is the 640 x 480 resolution and no longer being limited to 15 seconds worth of video.  Now your only limitation is the size of your memory stick.<br />One recommendation if you decide on this camera, get a spare battery or the starter kit that includes the spare battery.  The battery life on this camera is about an hour and fifteen minutes.  Not long enough for an event or a day out on vacation.  Also get at least a 128 MB memory stick.  The 32 MB stick that comes with the camera only gives you 24 pictures in the 5 megapixel mode.  Again not enough for a day out.",B00008O35W,B00008O35W,AH4VJARDTA54LALJYR5STGVCEV3A,30:11.0,9,TRUE,1977,4.7,3,5

I even moved my mesh access point closer…it’s 8’ away, and the camera still goes offline.  I can hit “refresh” a million times and it won’t do anything.

In the 3 days I’ve had this second camera up, it has only been properly functioned for a handful of hours while I have synced it 4 separate times.  Disappointing, to say the least.

1,Plagued With Issues,"I have had nothing but problems with this unit since I got it, and Pioneer support is completely useless.<br />I could go on and on about this issues with this unit, but I'll just mention some of the big ones:<br /><br />1) It constantly pops up with a message saying the brake cable is incorrectly installed.  I brought it back to the shop to have it ""fixed,"" and it still does it no matter what.  This ""safety"" message pops up over my back-up camera and navigation, requires manual interaction, and is extremely dangerous.  This could easily cause an accident.<br />2) Music navigation is atrocious.<br />3) Support takes days or weeks to respond to requests for assistance, answers questions you didn't ask, and doesn't help at all in the long run.  Useless.<br />4) USB drives are often not recognized, or say ""format read"" permanently, and never play.<br />5) SD cards suddenly stop working, and will play one song, then stop.  The unit needs to be restarted to play the next song.<br />6) Android Auto has been updated to work wirelessly with non-Google phones, but it still doesn't work with this unit.  It has to be plugged in, killing its primary feature.<br />7) Android Auto very often crashes when used with this unit, even sometimes causing the phone to restart.<br />8) Volume and track controls often stop responding, especially when used with Android Auto.<br />9) The unit won't display any album art that's not .jpg or is over a tiny 500x500 pixels.  What year is this?<br />10) Very difficult to find info on how things work, and specifics on the unit.  What exactly does ""loudness"" do (what changes does it make, to which frequencies, at which volumes)? What SD cards are actually compatible, and how should they be formatted?

2,I can't recommend this brand of memory,"Summary: Komputerbay memory doesn't appear to be reliable - if you care about stability then spend more on another brand.<br /><br />This is a combined review for [[ASIN:B006JO2KXQ Komputerbay 32GB ( 4 X 8GB ) DDR3 PC3-12800 1600MHz DIMM with Low Profile Blue Heatspreaders 240-Pin Dual / Quad Channel RAM Desktop Memory KIT 9-9-9-24 XMP ready]] as well as [[ASIN:B00698WP50 Komputerbay 16GB (2x 8GB) DDR3 PC3-10600 10666 1333MHz SODIMM 204-Pin Laptop Memory 9-9-9-25]], both of which I purchased earlier this summer. The desktop set was for my Windows 7 desktop (a custom build) and the laptop memory was for my Macbook Pro late 2011 model.<br /><br />I've been a systems administrator professionally for twelve years now, and have messed around with computers my whole life. I've learned that it's always a good idea to test new memory with Memtest86+ overnight at the very least, which is what I did upon receiving both sets of Komputerbay memory. There is a MemTest application for Mac OSX that I used, which is a little different from Memtest86+, but seems to work in a similar way. What I've found is that bad memory fails memory tests almost immediately, so it's not hard to tell if you've gotten a set with one or more bad modules right away.<br /><br />Both sets of memory from my first order failed memory tests immediately. I decided I wasn't going to fool around with my Mac so I returned the Komputerbay laptop memory and ordered [[ASIN:B006DI9PG8 Corsair 16GB Dual Channel DDR3 SODIMM Memory Kit (CMSO16GX3M2A1333C9)]], which passed thorough memory testing. My Macbook Pro has been totally stable for almost three months.<br /><br />I did, however, decide to give Komputerbay another chance with the desktop memory so I ordered another set of [[ASIN:B006JO2KXQ Komputerbay 32GB ( 4 X 8GB ) DDR3 PC3-12800 1600MHz DIMM with Low Profile Blue Heatspreaders 240-Pin Dual / Quad Channel RAM Desktop Memory KIT 9-9-9-24 XMP ready]] after returning the bad set. Komputerbay was still quite a bit cheaper for 32GB of memory and I figured that hey, every manufacturer has a bad module now and then (although I can't remember the last time I had a bad memory module out of hundreds of desktop, server and laptop memory modules I've purchased).<br /><br />When I received the new Komputerbay 32GB desktop set, I tested them thoroughly with Memtest86+, of course. All tests passed overnight and since this was a brand new desktop I had just built, I decided to do some burn-in testing with IntelBurnTest and Prime95, both of which stress the CPU and memory pretty extensively (one could say the system as a whole is well tested). If memory passes Memtest86+ and the system remains stable after a few IntelBurnTest and Prime95 runs, it's been my experience that it's a good bet that the system is going to run stable even under the heaviest of loads.<br /><br />What I found odd is that the Komputerbay 32GB kit passed thorough Memtest86+ testing, but Prime95 workers would die with errors which usually means something is wrong with the underlying hardware. I did a ton of research on this and could find nothing conclusive as to why Memtest86+ tests would pass yet Prime95 would fail (my CPU temps were well within range). I chalked it up to an anomaly and decided to let it go. I just assumed the memory was good, and maybe Prime95 was failing on new hardware or something.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I could never seem to get my desktop to run stable. It would run fine for several days to over a week, and then my system would crash (blue screen of death or BSOD) with a MEMORY_MANAGEMENT error. This usually means bad memory or a bad driver, and many forums would say ""test with Memtest86+!"" and most of the time people would report back that they indeed had a bad memory module. Of course I had already done this, several times, and each test PASSED for me. This was mind boggling. I ran WhoCrashed to analyze the crash dump files, but all it told me was:<br /><br />crash dump file: C:\Windows\Minidump\090212-9625-01.dmp<br />This was probably caused by the following module: ntoskrnl.exe (nt+0x7F1C0)<br />Bugcheck code: 0x1A (0x41790, 0xFFFFFA8012EDF3F0, 0xFFFF, 0x0)<br />Error: MEMORY_MANAGEMENT<br />file path: C:\Windows\system32\ntoskrnl.exe<br />product: Microsoft® Windows® Operating System<br />company: Microsoft Corporation<br />description: NT Kernel & System<br />Bug check description: This indicates that a severe memory management error occurred. This might be a case of memory corruption. More often memory corruption happens because of software errors in buggy drivers, not because of faulty RAM modules. The crash took place in the Windows kernel. Possibly this problem is caused by another driver which cannot be identified at this time.<br /><br />What I found in my research, however, was that MEMORY_MANAGEMENT errors typically were due to faulty memory modules! But again, the Komputerbay memory was passing all memory tests! I just couldn't seem to narrow down the MEMORY_MANAGEMENT errors to something specific.<br /><br />I spent several hours researching and testing various things out but could never seem to figure out what was going on. I couldn't point to any one thing as conclusively being the culprit, but I just couldn't get over how Prime95 was failing. This has NEVER happened before on many system builds. On a gut level, I felt that it had to be the memory, somehow, but couldn't prove it. The only anomaly I was experiencing with with Prime95, and of course the crashing every 1-2 weeks. Every other test passed.<br /><br />I finally got fed up a few weeks ago and decided to replace the Komputerbay memory with a set of [[ASIN:B0033BTACM Kingston Technology HyperX 16 GB Kit (4x4 GB Modules) 16 Quad Channel Kit 1600 (PC3 12800) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM KHX1600C9D3K4/16GX]], which is also certified to work with my [[ASIN:B005FGMQAQ ASRock MB-P67E4G3 LGA 1155 Intel P67 SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard]]. I don't know if this makes much difference, but I wanted to be extra safe. My desktop HAS to be extremely stable for the work I do, and I was tired of losing so much productivity over this.<br /><br />Yesterday I experienced another BSOD (of course right when I had a ton of stuff open), so I decided it was time to install the Kingston memory (I haven't had time). So far I've run Memtest86+ overnight, a few IntelBurnTest runs and several hours of Prime95. Absolutely everything has passed - all Prime95 threads were running stable after several hours, where as before with the Komputerbay memory, a few threads would die with errors almost immediately.<br /><br />I still don't know if the Komputerbay memory was bad, or if it was just a combination of my motherboard and the memory, or something else. All I know is Prime95 would fail with the Komputerbay memory, and has run successfully with the Kingston memory for several hours. So far my desktop appears to be running stable - we'll see if I have any more BSODs over the coming weeks. At this point, I'm highly confident I won't.<br /><br />If you care at all about productivity and you need your systems to run stable, then I don't recommend you purchase any memory from Komputerbay. Spend extra on G.Skill, Crucial, Kingston, etc. Either way, I highly recommend thoroughly testing ANY new memory modules in the manner I described above.",B00698WP50,B00698WP50,AHLEUWSV62G45HPULLFAIUFLWEJQ,55:32.0,3,TRUE,7358,4.9,2,5

Its takes great -- normal pictures but while investigating its capabilities, I found two surprises. Under the Magic filter scheme - watercolor is washed out without spectral colors and form.  Also, line drawing is washed out almost completely. I contacted the manufacturer and was told after the gentleman on the phone fetched a camera that -- I was right! but that there is currently no fix nor firmware for the problem.

1,Maybe It Will All Work Out.,"7/27/2017: My concerns have increased. I called Netgear today and I am told this device is NOT SUPPORTED IN THE US. I was told that by two technicians so far. I can't find anyone to talk to at the company to register a complaint.<br /><br />If you go to Netgear's website and look up the DC112A you can select &#34;Buy Now&#34; and it directs you to Amazon. The Netgear support page shows my device and serial number with hardware, phone, chat, email support good until 14/OCT/2017. Hardware support/warranty is available until 16/Jul/2018. Yet I'm stuck. If they refuse what can I do? Even if I bug enough to help me this is not what I'm paying for and it is not what I deserve as a customer.<br /><br />This unit works somewhat. The problems I've experienced so far are:<br />1) great download but very slow upload speeds (20 Mbps down / 0.05 Mbps up)<br />2) Readyshare not working<br />3) UPnP not working<br /><br />No support to get any of this working. I expect I will have to return this product for a refund. I'm so disappointed.<br /><br />If anyone knows another option where I can use my ATT Unite Pro and share that with wired Ethernet devices could you please add a comment? The DC112A provided 4 Ethernet LAN connections which I need here at home.<br /><br />Day 1 and I'm a bit concerned.<br /><br />1) Make sure you turn off pop-up blockers for site netgear.cradle. Otherwise certain functions such as configuring readyshare will not work. You may not  notice this if you accept the defaults.<br /><br />2) It takes a long time to boot and be ready for a network connection. At first I thought it wasn't going to connect and spent a while restarting before I realized you have to give it a minute or so to complete all the stuff it has to do.<br /><br />3) Sometimes, after rebooting the cradle, my PC would not connect. It showed &#34;connecting&#34; in wifi setup but until I actually hit the connect button it was just sitting there. This could be a problem. I just read a review from 20 June and this seems like the same issue. I'm not going to like fighting this box if it keeps happening.<br /><br />4) I have struggled with readyshare. I couldn't connect to \\readyshare. Well I remembered I turned off SMB 1.0/CIFS after the recent rash of incidents where files were encrypted. Unfortunately it seems SMB is required. This has me real concerned. I want readyshare but I don't want to leave an open door.<br /><br />5) I was on the phone with Netgear. Not a whole lot of help there. I solved the pop-up and smb issue myself. One thing the guy said had me concerned. He said I should not expect any firmware upgrades from Netgear. He said that even though I bought this unlocked from Amazon I should expect any upgrades to come from ATT (my carrier). That really has me concerned because I didn't buy from ATT and I'm pretty sure I can't call ATT for support. What are they going to upgrade in my router?<br /><br />6) If you need support get it quickly. While most companies will work with you for up to a year (I think) you only have 90 days with Netgear before they want more  money from you. In addition, I think they hire the same support team to work their community support option that Microsoft uses in their community. Netgear, like Microsoft has basically outsourced their support to users and sprinkles in a few &#34;Dear customer please reboot and report back your problem ok thanks.&#34; This usually leads to a few pages of trial and error and commiseration. Fellow customers good, BS tech support bad.<br /><br />7) Sometimes (often) when I plug in my readyshare drive the cradle reboots knocking me off line for at least a minute. This is after doing a safe remove, waiting some time, then plugging it in. This is the same drive I had been using with my R8000 without problem.<br /><br />I am using this with my old AirCard that has been a real workhorse for years. The cradle will hopefully extend the range in my home and improve the 4G signal I'm receiving from the tower. I'll be back in a while to hopefully post some happy updates. Right now I'm just hoping some of these glitches and concerns are simply my level of paranoia with any new device these days.",B06X3QV7LX,B06X3QV7LX,AHWE4DJNE6MNLIQQUAU2XPPRSOWQ,35:55.1,3,TRUE,4202,3.8,1,4
4,Solid tomato router with some caveats.,"I ordered a new N60 directly from Tenda, and received an N600 that was clearly opened. Box was damaged (not the shipping box, the product box,) label torn off, etc. At this time the N600 doesn't even seem to even exist elsewhere on the internet and may or may not have the same specs as the N60. Hard to verify.<br /><br />Thankfully it still flashed Tomato just fine (using shibby's N60 image,) so I didn't feel it was worth making a fuss over and being without a router for another few days. I've been running it full-time for about 2 months now and it seems solid. Ultimately I'd say this is a good option for Tomato-supported hardware comparable to more expensive ASUS units if you want to save a bit of cash, but be aware the seller/manufacturer seems a little shady.",B009TQ8LMU,B009TQ8LMU,AEIRAV5AGTY4FGNECVZ4QBFKK4KQ,54:42.0,0,TRUE,772,4.3,4,4

5,Great sound and microphone for the price!,"If I had bought these headphones solely for listening to music for $130, I'd be happy with my purchase. But they also come with a great microphone.<br /><br />Sound:<br />Bass has good sense of pace and impact without being too overly hyped like certain trendy music listening headphones. With a proper headphone amp, bass is fuller and better defined. Treble is extended enough but not terribly airy. Good sound staging for a headphone in this price range. Through the front panel jacks on a PC, the sound as A OK as these drivers are plenty efficient. These don't sound like a high-end Sennheiser headphone, but they also don't sound like crap without a headphone amp and they're much more affordable.<br /><br />Looks:<br />Most gaming headsets look ridiculous. No neon green or flashing lights on these. Understated black with red trim.<br /><br />Volume Control:<br />The volume control rolls off the treble just a tad. Not an issue for gaming but for music listening you'll want the volume on the headphones full up, using the volume on the device instead.<br /><br />Background Noise:<br />These are open back, so they hardly block out any background noise, but you have the added advantage of being able to hear your voice when you speak. Fully closed headphones make me a bit claustrophobic but that's a personal preference. For noisy environments you'd be better off with the Game Zero as those are closed back.<br /><br />Microphone:<br />The mic is excellent. It is neither boomy nor shrill. The noise reduction isn't overly aggressive. Voice sounds very natural. Mic shuts off when the arm is in the up position.<br /><br />Comfort:<br />These aren't so comfy you forget you're wearing them like the Sennheiser HD-600. The velour pads are stiffer, as is the clamping force. The big takeaway is these things stay on your head. With careful adjustment they can be comfortable enough. They do not make my ears sweaty. I wore these the week my A/C broke down in 90F heat. They aren't swampy like some headphones.<br /><br />Cables:<br />I refuse to buy headphones that don't have replaceable cables as the cable is usually the first thing to fail. These come with a cable for PC and a cable for phone/tablet/controller. Single entry into the left side cup. Snug connection but easy to pull out to swap if tugged on directly.<br /><br />I would recommend these to a friend.",B00KK8ZLEC,B00KK8ZLEC,AH2BXZXYSM77FQBYH3YD54BPUTLQ,16:21.1,0,TRUE,2381,3,5,3

5,"Great mouse, near perfect","Being a serious gamer, I've gone through several mice over the course of a few years. This is the best mouse I've used yet, and I don't think I'll be getting a new one anytime soon.<br />The mouse performs very well on all fronts. It's extremely easy to use (I plugged and played... I have YET to install anything from the CD). Setting up my mouse buttons for my favorite games is an absolute breeze. The thumb button is positioned just right, and is very handy for switching out weapons, etc. The scroll wheel feels solid and tactile in a most pleasant way. The side-scroll feature of the tilt wheel is nice, but on my widescreen 22"" monitor (1680x1050), I rarely use it. The clicking function of the wheel isn't the best in the world (it's a bit hard to line up the click sometimes, depending on the angle that you have your finger on the wheel), but it performs consistantly well regardless.<br />A great feature, the sensitivity buttons are a plus. The placement may seem a bit strange at first, but they easily become second nature. The presets for the buttons work fine. I've not yet felt the need to tweak them. I primarily use the middle (800dpi) setting.<br />The weight feature of the mouse is very cool, and if you're a serious gamer, you'll know how crucial it is. I keep mine fairly light, although I like a little weight to keep it feeling solid and smooth. Combined with the slick pads on the bottom, this thing glides effortlessly and with great precision.<br />Finally, on the plus list, this mouse looks amazing. The rust/silver paint job is unique and great looking. It's a sexy looking mouse the performs as well as it looks. In addition, Logitech has proved an excellent material and texture from gripping the G5. I have found that even with sweaty or greasy hands, I'm able to grip this thing comfortably and easily. No slick surfaces prone to build up and slipping...<br />There are almost no cons to this thing. The biggest drawback for me is that, perhaps due to my relatively small hands, the size of the mouse is a bit akward. The right side of the mouse (where my ring and pinky finger wrap around it) is a bit too far extended, making my ring finger placement strained. It feels as though I should rest my ring finger on the mouse2 button, but this clutters it, confuses my hand, and makes the mouse a bit to heavy to pick up comfortably with just my pinky.<br />This is a pain, to be sure, but a minor one that can't be set for each customer. We all have different sized hands, eh?. However, lightening the mouse helped out a good bit.<br />Overall, an excellent mouse. I really recommend it if you're a serious gamer or if you just like to have quality components.

The buttons are too far back from where the thumb naturally sits. To make things worse, these forward and back buttons are shaped ridiculously inapproprately for the task. In an ironic twist, the knob that sits ahead of those buttons is too easy to operate by accident. In frustration, I simply disabled it. It is so hard to tell which one is which or if the finger is even on it at all.<br />The one exotic feature that I really like is the scroll wheel which switches from ratcheting to freewheeling on demand.

But I was able to drop a new hard drive into it and have it up an running in no time.  The plastic end piece that holds the end of hard drive (opposite the connectors) in place took a little jiggling to get the drive to align into the slot, but once I got that to line up the case closed up nicely and holds the drive snugly.  No complaints at all - got much more value than I paid for...  Woudl definitely purchase again.<br /><br />***************<br /><br />Okay so here it is 3 months later and I have been having problems where the product is no longer recognized by either of my computers.  I do not swap drives in and out of the enclosure - I only plug the complete assembly in to my computer once every weeks or two for a few hours or so.  Light usage.  It got flakey one day before finally quitting and has not worked since.<br /><br />I had just written it off and was taking the drive out and shopping for a new enclosure when I realized that there is some looseness to how the drive fits into the enclosure which had allowed the drive to partially unseat from the connector built into the enclosure.  Since I do not swap the drive in and out I never had the chance to notice or re-seat the drive.  Pushed the drive back onto the plug and it works.  Guess I will be inserting a something to snug up how the drive fits within the enclosure as I reassemble...",B000FNBYKW,B000FNBYKW,AGKSGVNHQ2VBI6VX3LEMYVHUYE7Q,50:27.0,0,TRUE,1507,4.2,4,4

3,"Heart monitor mis-reads and gets ""stuck"" at single rate","After lots of investigation this device had more of the features I wanted, although much more bulky than I preferred.  However, it has some issues.  Mainly the heart-rate monitor is frequently inaccurate.  It gets &#34;stuck&#34; on a particular reading and won't budge even if I vary my intensity and know my heart-rate is up higher.  The other day I wore my chest band and compared treadmill reading to the watch - the watch didn't keep up with my heart-rate by a wide margin.  The chest band read as 140 on the treadmill monitor, and only 91 on the band - where it was basically &#34;stuck&#34; - so it isn't very helpful as the main device for monitoring heart.  I may contact Garmin to find out if this is normal for this device.<br /><br />Otherwise I like it.  I do wish it had an app for water aerobics and elliptical, and would use the swimming software to count laps and swim metrics that the Garmin Swim uses.

1,I bought from Monoprice and left a review there...,"...but surprisingly they didn't post it.  I would not call these junk, but they are not worth $80, imo. Maybe I was spoiled with my $2 JLab earbuds but these don't beat it by much. If they were $2, these might be worth $5. These are actually less comfortable, though, and do not include a mic which my $2 JLabs do.<br /><br />The MP80 sound is not good anywhere in the spectrum:<br /><br /> The bass is weak, almost non-existant below 80 hertz. There is bass and sometime it is fairly good, but I can turn my EQ all the way up and it doesn't sound like it increases the bass at all. I turned the 31 and 62 hz bands all the way up and the bass boost and the bass sounds unaffected by the increase. These adjustments would be too much for any of my headphones or for the Monoprice M300. I expect bass from $80 earbuds to be more powerful than $2 JLab earbuds but not with these.<br /><br />There are peaks within the entire range of mid and high-end. The mids have bits of chestiness and nasally. The highs are shrill and tinny. I truly truly do not like the sound of these headphones.<br /><br />I broke them in for 15 hours. I spent probably 5 hours listening to them. They sounded ok at first, I was actually impressed at first, but it didn't take long before I noticed a lot of issues with the response of these.<br /><br />To give you an understanding of the level of what I have to listen to: I own AT M50X, Sennheiser HD600, Monoprice M1060 and M300, and a few other headphones. I have bought and returned Nuraphone and B&W P7 Wireless.  The AT M50X are my favorite of the lot. I trust the HD600 the most but find the highs crackly and the bass reserved. Monprice's competing iems, the M300, are pretty good if you can get them comfortable.  For a heck of a lot cheaper, I believe the earbuds that sound just about as good are the JLabs JBuds pro. I got a 5-pack on eBay for $10, but they usually run $10 a pair and they sound just about as good relative to these and come with a mic and I know they are durable.",B07957RVZ1,B07957RVZ1,AEIYWQILFQWQ5FGHLGBFJTZPKOJQ,40:04.2,1,FALSE,2017,4.3,1,4
3,Don't care for the on-board DAC,"The built in DAC on the unit doesn't help the sound. It makes the sound more grainy and piercing in the high-end.

It isn't drastically noticeable, but I have noticed that I always by-pass the mini usb DAC in favor of using the 3.5mm cable.<br /><br />The amp gives more juice than my phone but was for the most part unnecessary and unneeded.",B0157DKAU4,B0157DKAU4,AEIYWQILFQWQ5FGHLGBFJTZPKOJQ,55:12.0,5,TRUE,432,4.3,3,4

What I mean is the treble is not completely as smooth as it should be, there seems to be a shimmer or break in the instruments.  For $55-$65, these come close to perfection IMO and rival the AT M50X.  These are for pure music lovers and not for people who like added bass.

I love that!!

I can understand that they might not feel right for some, but no complaints at all on my side.  I switched to the smallest tip, which fit my ear well...and I found that bouncing all over the place the headphones never budged at all.  I also love that I can take off my sweatshirt, after working out, and not pull them out.  My old cheap set, which died after 8 months, had the stick that always got snagged.  These do not!<br /><br />- Sound quality is perfect for me, but again I am coming from spending about $30-50 on nameless headphones in the past.  This is not my first Apple product at all, but it is my first Apple headphone (short of the ones they give you with some devices). I can not, and would never try to, compare the sound between this and Airpods since I don’t have experience there. But it is rich in base, and I am very happy with it.<br /><br />More to come...I will play with them and if my views change I will share with the community.  $200 is not cheap to spend, and I think being honest with others is important.

5,Much better than the H700,"I started with the Motorola H700 when I bought my Blackberry 7100i. I purchased 2 of them; had horrible issues with both.  Any background noise and the person on the other end couldn't hear me at all.  Also about half the time, when I would make a call and the headset would connect, the phone wouldn't release - it was like the worst voice distortion unit made.  I could hear the person I was calling just fine through either the phone or the headset - AT THE SAME TIME - but although they could hear me, they couldn't understand me at all.  I was told it was a malfunction in my headset, so I bought another.  Same thing.  I then tried the Jawbone, and that just hurt my ears.  Warily, I purchased the Motorola H710.  Wow, what a difference!  Got the comfort, and no issues with people hearing me or voice distortion!  Oh, and it does say 200 charges, but I have had mine for just over 1 year, wearing it constantly and charging it about every 2nd or 3rd day (depending on how much talking I do), with no significant loss in talk time or standby so far.<br /><br />If you are more active, I have found that by using clothing tape behind my ear it stays much more securely.  That being said, the tape does make it a little more trouble putting on/taking off eyeglasses and sunglasses.  It really is so light you forget you are wearing it - and prior to using the tape, I almost lost it in Lake Michigan because I forgot I was wearing it when I leaned over the side of our boat!<br /><br />It is boating season again here, and I am buying a second headset, just in case I do lose this one.  It has made itself invaluable to me, since my phone is so awkward to hold up to my ear.

Duh.<br /><br />i put off writing reviews about tech stuff sometimes. i thinks it is because i feel as if i should be writing a novel to do the review justice. this is not a novel, this will be short and sweet. first off this is a discontinued model, so not sure you can buy it anymore. here is what i think;<br /><br />Likes;<br />1. my TV remote (and Tivo remote) makes the volume change on this system.<br />2. it is not an obnoxious sound bar. those are ugly, expensive and ridiculous.<br />3. it is well designed and looks good.<br />4. it sounds good<br />5. volume range is good<br />6. the bluetooth connection to other bluetooth devises works well (i used my iPhone and it sounded awesome).<br /><br />Dislikes and other comments;<br />1. you have to get use to the sound not coming on for about 5 to 7 seconds after start up. it goes to sleep when there is no sound received, see next comment.<br />2. it shuts off automatically after no sound received for about 90 seconds or 2 minutes. so if you pause a show and come back in 5 minutes, the sounds takes 5 seconds to start but the show has started as soon as you hit play.<br />3. there can be an echo if you don't do the volume correctly/know how to do the volume. there is a delay with the system because of the digital sound or the optical inputs or the system or whatever. so if the TV speakers are loud enough to hear and the system is working there is a double sound track. it's way annoying. to avoid this you have to drive the TV sound all the way off, then use the dedicated remote for this speaker system to drive that sound only back up, then go back to the original remote. that normally works unless you drive the sound on the system down too low after having the TV at zero. when you drive the sound up again the TV speakers go up with the system sound and the problem is back. if you pay attention and remember how to operate the remote (within a range) you are fine. if someone else is not aware of the way it works, it gets screwed up every day.

5,Using the Splitter in AVR Mode with great success,"I do have an older Pioneer Susano SC 09TX (HDMI 1.4) and a new HDMI 2.1 TV in a 7.2 home theater setting. My 4k Blu-ray player has two HDMI, one is for exact this reason, to connect uncompressed HDMI audio to the receiver. However, my NVIDIA streaming device does not provide a separate HDMI output, so I needed to utilize an optic cable from the TV to the receiver. This was fine, but the sound is compressed, and no higher quality sound formats are provided thru this connection. The gofanco Prophecy Splitter was the solution to this, using the AVR mode setting with great results and MUCH better/more dynamic audio quality now. The only problem was, only one subwoofer was paying. The subwoofers are connected to the receiver, the Susano receiver has an output for each one. I managed it by using a Y subwoofer cable to connect both subwoofers on one subwoofer output on the receiver. Maybe there is a fix for this coming with a firmware update. The gofanco Prophecy splitter is firmware upgradable, not sure where I find new firmware when available, there is nothing in the manual about this and no files to download on gofanco’s website.",B08W9T6DTW,B0BL1YLVS3,AGLEA22SAEFUSRCQCDMTXOM3SLHA,59:56.4,0,TRUE,1143,4.8,5,5

This television ""hands down"" outdoes my Sony in sound, picture quality and adjustment features. In fact, if you stand to the side of our Sony, the picture becomes very blurry--not so with the Samsung.<br /><br />The menu is very user friendly and I really like the fact that you can set the volume to adjust with channel changes.  Our cable system is such that some stations are much louder than others.  With a quick adjustment on the Samsung, that no longer is a problem.<br /><br />Amazon's shipping is so fast and free shipping is sure a plus.  We actually paid less for this television than we did for our Sony and this is a better television.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this television to any looking for a high quality flat screen.

For driving I have a road specific GPS.<br /><br />Second star loss goes to the way it's programmed.  I do NOT find it to be an easy gadget to operate.  Having had it nearly a year I still fumble around going from one function to another.  It is not intuitive in the least.<br /> --  The pros, at least those I feel to be better than not:<br />Lightweight.  Even with the two AA batteries this GPS is fairly light.<br />Tracking.  Once you figure out where it is, the tracking display seems fairly accurate.  Again, having bought this for hiking and backpacking, both traits are very important to me.<br /><br />Also, the Legend HCx feels sturdy.  I haven't yet dropped it (mostly because of using the supplied lanyard) but I am hopeful if/when I do it will continue to operate.<br /><br />Lastly, shop around.

This thing is trash! what a piece of junk! when you look here on Amazon it seems that some of the sharp brand tv's have high ratings. That's because people leave reviews right after they buy it. BUT wait a few months or a year. Google &#34;sharp aquos&#34; issues and watch how many things pop up! and it seems for A LOT of their LED's there are issues<br /><br />yes the picture will look great! yes you will have lots of options to control the picture just how you like it...etc and then you will leave a nice review! All seems awesome....UNTIL they're not.<br /><br />8 months after purchase, there were bright little hot spots scattered around random areas of the screen and only show when lighter colors are displayed. Can't see them at all when there's dark colors on screen. but they look terrible<br /><br />Now all of a sudden, for no reason and just at random the tv will flicker black and the screen goes almost completely dark after a bit ...to the point where you can hardly see anything at all.

5,A Great Buy for Lighter Cameras,"I've now taken this tripod to Paris, London, in and out of the ocean all over CA, into the desert throughout CA, onto various pool decks, in hot weather up to 110 degrees, and into the snow in the CA mountains. It's great. I use it with my Sony a6000, which is a relatively light camera, and it's been fantastic.<br />I did try it out with a larger lens at one point, and the head absolutely couldn't handle it. So, once you get to something that's a bit heavier in the front, this is going to have problems. But if you've got a mirrorless camera with a lens that's less than 100mm, you're going to be fine, and this little guy is going to serve you well. It fits in my suitcase or it can carry on in the plane.

3,"Passable, has both good and bad qualities","PRO'S:<br />Lightweight and fits great on my ear.  Easy to cover up with hair and doesn't ""stick out"" the way 99% of bluetooths do.  Also, I can see how this would be great to use laying down in bed so as not to disturb anyone else.  Low cost and pleasing aesthetic design.  Nicely packaged.  Comes with a removable rubber eartip.<br /><br />CON'S:<br />Sound is ""tinny"" and passable at best.  At the lowest volume setting with the removable eartip ON, it's almost too loud for me.  If I take the eartip off, it's much better, but if you take it off your head and move it around, you can hear it.  If you turn it up all the way and set it on the table, both you and anyone near you can enjoy the same music like some sort of mini-speaker.  Callers report my voice sounds ""passable"" but tinny on their end.<br /><br />Overall Impression:<br />I am too lazy to mess with returning it (since I don't ""hate"" it, I'm just apathetic about it), so I will keep it as a backup while I look for a different bluetooth to wear as my daily driver.  Because it's cheap, I don't feel like I really ""lost out"" in any way.

5,Work pretty well and keeps down all the YELLING,"I like this set mainly because I had another intercom set and got tired of having to use it like a walkie-talkie where you'd have to push the button to talk.<br /><br />This set has full-duplex communications so you can speak with the other person without having to press a button when you want to speak, or worry about talking over them at the same time they're pushing to talk.<br /><br />It's not without its minor issues, though. It does have a bit of static on some channels, so it takes a while to find a channel where you can get a clear line depending on where you locate these and how close they are to other electronics which can affect the signal.<br /><br />Still, this keeps down the yelling and a lot of misunderstandings when I'm upstairs and my wife is downstairs.<br /><br />The size is fine for an intercom and it works well (as long as you can find a good open channel). So far, it hasn't had any issues with random noise like some of the other intercoms that would pick up random static from other signals from time to time (maybe when an airplane was flying over or someone else with a similar walkie-talkie in the neighborhood was using one). This one doesn't seem to even open a channel until you hit the call button, which is a big plus. It's not sitting in continuous communication mode except for the contact channel which still broadcasts when calling the other intercom, but the other intercom's speaker doesn't turn on until you hit the ""answer"" call button. Thus, there's almost no chance of getting that random static burst you get from the walkie-talkie kind of intercom.<br /><br />I like that you can many more of these to have one in every room if you wanted. Really, all we'll need is upstairs/downstairs, but I can see where it would be useful in large houses, or for communicating with kids inside their rooms on their headphones.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty nice set of intercoms for people who don't want to have to constantly keep screaming, ""WHAT?!"" back and forth if one person is in a distant room. The price is just okay at the current price of $80 for the 2-pack, but it gets better if you need more than just two.",B095WSBB4V,B095WSBB4V,AE24VPMWEEQD62YPOG53BW7JCGFA,46:39.1,0,FALSE,2169,4.7,5,5
2,Maybe a nice learning toy . . . but way too expensive for such a cheap quality item.,"This is most definitely a toy microscope. The reason I say it's a toy is because it does magnify objects and comes with a set of accessories that can be used to study small objects and magnify them.<br /><br />However, it's not that great as a microscope but it could be fun as a toy for kids who want to see certain things up close.<br /><br />It has a nice sized view-screen and it's easy to charge and operate.<br /><br />The main issues I have are a few. The included accessories are a set of 5 pre-prepared/stained slides of various things like cross-section slices of an earthworm, plant-stems, and the like. There are also 5 blank slides with 5 glass cover-slips. There's a pretty flimsy plastic tweezer that's a little larger than it probably should be, and a joke of a liquid dropper (see photos).  It also comes with a small chunk of quartz crystal that isn't anything like the geode pictured on the box. It's just a chunk of crystal as far as I can tell -- might not even be quartz.<br /><br />There is a 128 MB micro-SD card included (That's right, I said MB and it's not a typo). I didn't even know they made micro-SD cards with such a small amount of memory. The photos are 1920x1280 so it's not going to hold a lot, especially if you're taking videos. The good news it that it will accept larger micro-SD cards so you can just put in a larger one if that becomes a problem. I can confirm it works with a 4GB micro-SD card but didn't test anything higher.<br /><br />This is clearly not intended for any serious use, but just as something for kids to play with to satisfy their curiosity by seeing what small objects look like up close -- but not too close. I've included a photo of two human hairs side-by-side at the 800x zoom. At that level of magnification, you can see a bit more detail, but you don't even see the bark-like layers that you would with a better microscope.<br /><br />Which comes to the biggest drawback. The magnification is pretty low at I think about 200x optical with the packaging stating ""800x Zoom"". Clearly, it's still only a 200x picture that has been digitally zoomed 4x which basically gives you the same level of detail as the 200x picture, but it's 4 times the size, but the number of pixels hasn't changed so there isn't the same level of detail as if you had an *actual* 800x microscope.<br /><br />I'm just not impressed by a 200x optical microscope even as a toy, especially at the current price of $90. That's an expensive magnifying glass with a few weak extras to jazz it up. You'd be much better off spending the $90 on a ""real"" microscope that has much better optical zoom. They can be found at a much better price.<br /><br />But, it's National Geographic, so that might have some brand appeal, but I'm disappointed in the quality and National Geographic should be embarrassed at putting their name on this. At least they could have spent a bit more on the optics.<br /><br />You can find pretty much this exact design in countless knock-offs which are typically used by coin or stamp collectors to get a better view of their stamps/coins. This one does have a view-screen which some of the others don't, so it might be just slightly more useful -- because as a toy a kid isn't going to want to wait until they're at a computer to see the photos.<br /><br />There's nothing in the manual about being able to hook this up via USB so that you can use it to view objects directly on your computer in real time. HOWEVER, it<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - Nice packaging and graphic art on the box<br /> - Giftable<br /> - Better than a handheld magnifying glass<br /> - When connected to a PC with the USB cable, you can copy pictures and videos from the microscope's micro-SD card right to the PC without having to remove the micro-SD card from the microscope. Save a little bit of time.<br /> - Light from the LED's is fairly bright<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - Low magnification for a microsope. Optical magnification states 200x, but I'm dubious of that.<br /> - Claims 800x zoom. That's like saying that if you watch a normal HD video on a 4K TV it becomes a 4K movie. Same concept here, the picture gets enlarged 4x, but there's no increase in the original 200x resolution, same number of pixels either way.<br /> -  Light only comes from above what you're viewing unless you rig up another light from below the slide. When looking at slides under a microscope, the images just aren't as good as when a slide is lit from below as well.<br /> - Can't be used as a PC microscope. I tried a lot of solutions and I'm still working on being able to use it in that way, but for now only the attached 4""x3"" screen will show a live image. There should be a way to connect it to a PC with the USB and view live images on the PC, but so far it seems like a complicated problem. But it would increase the useability of this microscope. If I find a way to get it to display on the PC screen live, I'll update this review.<br /><br />So on to my conclusion. I really wanted to like this more, especially considering the NG brand, but . . . .<br /><br />I have to subtract a star for the price, even if the National Geographic brand has some value, it's not enough to make up for the fact that this is a very-low end toy microscope and the current $90 price is not justifiable, IMO.<br /><br />I have to subtract another star for the poor quality accessories that are included. Literally every accessory included is the cheapest thing they could find. The plastic is flimsy and the controls are clunky and the manual is dismal.<br /><br />Overall, if you need a quick toy for a kid, it works, but you'd be better off spending the same amount on a much better microscope. It's got a lot of flash and marketing glitz, but the product is very sub-par and I definitely expect more from National Geographic. Think of the children, NG -- they are our future and they deserve a better effort than this.",B07R92KSBG,B07R92KSBG,AE24VPMWEEQD62YPOG53BW7JCGFA,45:08.8,4,FALSE,5931,4,2,4

4,I LIKE - Great study tool for a musician. REALLY CONVENIENT AND DOES THE JOB!,"I just received these Logitech USB Laptop Speaker(s) and clipped the device onto my Apple MacBook Pro - plugged in the USB cable that comes with it (and is attached with a little groove in the top of the speaker which I really like - as I tend to set things down and can't find them the next minute).  Then,  I went into the sound menu on my MAC, selected this device and a moment later, amplification was achieved.  Then I tested it with a UTUBE video of the Mozart Requiem. .....and after only a few measures of  loudest movement (The Dies Irae) I was able to come to a conclusion about my purchase;  I LIKE! I LIKE ALOT!<br /><br />Background:<br />I'm a classical musician and use my computer for audio research and rehearsal every day.  I'm a choral conductor and am constantly listening to all sorts of mp3 /WAV or other such audio files to dissect and analyze scores that I either have to conduct or sing or  -- usually, both. Often I will have the file of some part of a large choral work or motet (A short piece of sacred choral music, typically polyphonic and unaccompanied) playing in the background while I do chores, run errands, cook, etc. etc. - so that the music gets into my ""bones"" --  OR, I'm listening to something that I have to perform, performed by others, or an original piece that a composer wants me to give feedback on, sent to me as a midi file via email.<br /><br />I have BOSE equipment, including the BOSE Wireless Soundlink Speaker and a wired BOSE stereo system with surround sound in my living room. So - I know good equipment. I like to use that equipment, but when I need to work, it always seems that others in family are using the good sound equipment OR  in the case of the BOSE Soundlink - it won't pair with my MAC - for a variety of annoying reasons.<br /><br />(At present, I have one week to learn the parts of the Mozart Requiem - so I'm studying constantly at every spare (or not so spare) moment.  I've already gone through three sets if laptop speakers, so I was reluctant to buy another device, but the pressure of having a crazy deadline to learn some gloriously complicated music in a ridiculous amount of time persuaded me to look for something. So, I went to my ""go-to"" source: AMAZON REVIEWS!)<br /><br />ENTER the Logitech USB LAPTOP SPEAKER Z305 --- Basically, this little speaker is extremely convenient; I don't have to hold onto it while moving my laptop around and the sound is really good.  It's what I would call a ""reliable WORK speaker.""  It's not high-end, and for that, I'm very glad. If it breaks when I throw it into my computer bag while rushing to a rehearsal or performance - I'm only out $50.<br /><br />I listen to things professionally. All the time. I have very sensitive hearing and can hear the speakers on my computer pretty well, even though they are awful.  What I need is a good speaker that I can actually hear through whatever else is going on - like running water in the kitchen sink, traffic noise, the dishwasher, kids yelling things to me, conversations in the next room, etc. So far, I'm really liking this device. It works well and the sound is very good.<br />I also need amplification that can process sound at the extreme ends of a dynamic spectrum - loud, very loud, orchestral sound waves emitted at piano (soft) or forte (loud).  Crackling and static is a deal breaker right away. I can't tolerate it for even a second as it actually hurts my ears.<br /><br />Granted, I've only had Logitech speaker for a few hours, but I'm relieved to have it. Ordered it yesterday through prime and paid the extra $3.99 to get it here in one day.  I LOVE AMAZON PRIME. It's such a great problem solver for a mom with four kids who also wants to pursue her passion for classical, sacred music.<br />I would guess that just about everyone else likes it too!  Anyway - I'll update if these speakers turn out to be a waste of money - if not, all you will hear from me, is silence!",B003VAK1I2,B003VAK1I2,AFSWGN3FU4RI6MVWCYR64S3IFQKA,17:37.0,2,TRUE,3957,4.5,4,5

The stero sound is excellent and I have enjoyed listening through them. I have a Kindle Fire and (I carry it with me always). I am more abt to stay in the car while my daughter goes shopping (my legs ache at times ) and I enjoy a movie or listen to music. I also have an iPhone and watch movies while waiting. I have hearing aids and it's all I can stand for the ear pieces to be in my ears. With this head set it's just perfect covering my entire ears. They are comfortable and you can adjust the fit for a small or large head (smile). The sound is very good and there is a handy volume control on the wire? (For lack of a better word.)

5,"Buy the genuine product for $12 more than generic cable price, you won't be sorry","This cable has worked absolutely flawlessly so far with (2) UV-5Rs and (1) UV-82.  Yes, it is $20.  I bought the cheaper, generic cable first.  I have had some problems with the generic cable.  This factory cable is perfect.  I also am using CHIRP now instead of the Baofeng software I was using previously.  I had some problems with my XP computer telling me I needed to install such and such file from the Recovery Disk when I used the generic cable and the Baofeng software.  So, for the lack of headaches with this genuine cable, I am happy I paid the extra $12 or so to get it.  This cable also comes with instructions and an install disk you can use if you need to.  I installed this today on my Windows 7 laptop, and I didn't need the disk.  I programmed my UV-5R and UV-82 today.  The nice thing CHIRP does as well is it reads the firmware from your radio and allows you to program without updates, at least it did for me.  Don't forget to &#34;read&#34; from your radio FIRST using CHIRP.  The software needs that done as the very first step in order to initialize your radio to the software.  Do this for EACH radio you have.  As a side note,  I did need the driver install disk for my XP installation for this cable on my older tower computer, tho.  I highly recommend this product.

Also, I don’t need an extender because the signal reaches everywhere in my home and outside and doesn’t drop.

To get the same volume on the fourth, I have to turn it to a level eight. I'm not really sure why that is. When speaking at a normal volume, the third picks up my voice better. When whispering, my fourth picks up my voice better. It's really strange. I know these devices learn as they go, getting updates and behind the scenes tweaks, so I'm hoping this will level out in the months to come.",B084J4KNDS,B08F1P3BCC,AHL6LDYWUDOBBBR6RCSJVX72J2LA,40:45.6,1,TRUE,735,4.4,4,4

It seems to play them just fine without loading any of the software that came with the unit, so I just tucked away the software so if needed I have it.  I haven't played a whole movie yet but it opens under fifteen seconds or way quicker and plays it then since I'm just uploading to Vudu I stop it and do my thing, but the picture is pulled up on screen for intro so I can tell it's playing the dvds.  One cable seems to be more than strong enough using HP CQ 60 usb port.  It's kind of light and flimsy but not bendable flimsy.  Expect the unit to be moving all arround while taking in and out discs, it's think just a half an inch high, so I finally ended up wedging it under the usb plug in and that seems to hold in a good place and keep it from moving all around, now I just need to find a shorter cable in my bag of cables to make it pretty, one that comes with it though has the magnet shield magnet on it so not sure if I should switch it out.  Push the button on the front and it pops right open not a fancy one like an x box but more like the ones that come with lap tops, latch is released and spring pops it open.  Makes some loud noises with some dvds and those were not properly pushed down enough so be careful of that.  Still some are just louder even when rightly inserted.  It's got a plastic sticker on top to make it look aluminum brushed, it's all plastic, so don't mistakingly try and peel it off as a clear protective sticker like the ones found all over unit when you get it like I did, didn't peel up at all but I was just lucky.  As I said plug and play replaces immediately your internal drive once auto driver finds right driver to communicate with unit, I'm using Windows 7.  Expect it to be smudgy on top from holding the unit down while closing it each time.  No fancy lights or anything just one blue or green activity light on front and one button on front to open it.  I think that covers it, as I said brand new and haven't played an entire disc, but very pleased on it's lightning speed of opening all my dvds when my drive would just click for minutes and still not open them.

Cable is very heavy, as I said seems to be all A1 quality.  Most pictures that aren't dark to start with are fine with no noticeable difference.  I'll shut up now, good cable for the money.  P.s. Has 3.5 mm plug in which goes in headphones spot on comp and I split the other end with an RCA splitter jack and hooked right up to the aux on my stereo for stereo sound, works just fine and moving the cables around to my gaming splitter fixes hum to a low noise if it's ever loud, don't get me wrong this cable is shielded well or so it seems, just a lot of extra wires and boxes (gaming switcher box) might be causing the hum (or feedback noise).

My bedroom happens to have white walls – and then there’s the wall-mounted TV with the black cables and cords running down the wall.  This drives me nuts.

Probably not in my lifetime but I can hope, or I can use this cord kit to hide the dreadful cable and cords dangling from my bedroom TV.  These were easy to install and the varied sizes and corner sections made it very easy to customize to suit the area.  Plus, if I decide to paint the room I can paint these as well.

1,CAD program Cabinet Vision problem,"Important CAD program info. I didn't actually hate this product. It would have been great for a dual monitor system, replacing the integrated graphics we had on board. Trouble is, it messes up Cabinet Vision, a cad program this company uses. I didn't know that until I finally called the Cabinet Vision's tech support - after trying every setting I could think of.

1,Biggest piece of crap ive ever bought!,"Cheap plastic feel, rattles when you tap the chassis with your finger.  Cheap buttons and switchgear offer no tactical feedback.  To compensate for this, LG built in a lo-fi, distorted female voice, who confirms your button presses with broken English, in a robotic/Asian voice.<br /><br />Pathetically, the cardboard box the headphones came in felt more expensive, sturdy, and the magnetic flapper that holds it shut offers more tactile feedback than the mess of poorly located, loose sliders and dull plastic buttons that rattle around on this abortion.<br /><br />I got the this device to pair flawlessly to my phone exactly one time, using the supplied NFC sticker that LG haphazardly slipped into the box because apparently, the cost savings of not having to &#34;apply a decal&#34; could allow them to include that glorious little magnetic flap on the box that the unit is packaged in.<br /><br />I finally had to resort to the &#34;manual pairing mode&#34; in order to resync it with my phone, which by-the-way can only be found on the poorly folded, tiny little instructions insert that was crammed inside the box.  There is (at the time of this review) no viewable manual for this product anywhere on LGs website.  I could only find the lower, previous models.<br /><br />I downloaded LGs companion app, another useless turd, which only provides a small set of equally useless app alert features.<br /><br />The sound quality is decent, but not quite worth the premium price tag, especially when you take into account the cheap build quality...<br /><br />Another horribly fatal flaw in this design, is the fact that it's essentially useless as a &#34;phone accessory&#34;  despite LG bragging about the fact that the unit includes &#34;dual microphones&#34;, they fail to notice that the unit could have 100 microphones, but they're all worthless when none of them are used to pick-up your own voice when you're in a phone call, so when you start talking, you are completely deafened to your own voice by the tight fiting ear bud , so you can't hear yourself talk, and you end up sounding like a deaf person mumbling when they try to verbalize.<br /><br />All in all, this thing is an overly expensive, cheaply made, illconceived, poorly engineered piece of junk.<br /><br />SAVE YOUR MONEY, skip the LG Tone!",B01DU1QV4Y,B01DU1QV4Y,AFQX2HGIAHRDNIKYBXCN4XX43ZBQ,41:56.0,3,FALSE,2319,2.2,1,2

5,Cooler,"I bought the 19inch cooler with the 3 fans. I positioned them exactly where i was finding my Toshiba laptop to be getting extremely hot. My laptop would overheat and shut down all the time. I run a ton of programs for my online school, itunes and even movies so I needed something to keep it from over heating... again. I have gone through and tried so many laptop coolers and I was yet to find one that did what it was suppose to do. Since I was able to move the fans where they were needed I haven't had my laptop overheat or shut down even once. The fans are so quiet I had to check multiple times to make sure they were indeed running and on the highest speed. There is a clip where you can place anywhere and adjust the speed of the fans. The USB to plug into your laptop so your cooler will run is slightly large. But that isn't something I can tolerate. It isn't too comfortable to put on your lap but if I lay it just right and right above my knees it is just fine on my lap. I have had is on my bed, couch, thick down comforters, floor and table and it still keeps my laptop very cool. If I lift my laptop up to touch the bottom its actually some what cool to the touch. I would say this laptop cooler is completely worth the $ no matter what. My search is over. I can pack it up in my book bag with my laptop as well. If I were you I wouldn't look anywhere else and buy this one. Don't get the smaller ones or ones with just one big fan in the center. They wont work and if your laptop is like mine it gets overheated towards the right side of my laptop, not the center. The option to move each fan and place it where it is needed is a huge plus Im yet to see anywhere else. A++++++!!!",B003ZMF27G,B00GFNH9H8,AGY3TISFVZ5HBUOUFKXAEF7IQDBA,38:05.0,0,TRUE,1695,4.7,5,5

5,Best Budget Projector Ever!!!! Backyard Movie Night !!!,"I couldn't be more happy with this projector! The price $200 was amazing for the quality. 1080p picture quality and for a 1 bedroom decent sound quality. I have hooked this up to a sound system and played movies outdoors on a 14 foot diagonal screen, beautiful picture and setup is so easy. Please note, the video shown in pictures is DVD quality 720p. A blue-ray would provide an even better picture. The blur in my pictures is only due to low light for my phone and movie wasn't paused. Please note that if you use the audio out please get another AV audio cable. The one provided is for two audio out and video. It will cause a buzz noise if used with external speakers. So get an AV cable with only the two (red and white) connections for audio. Hook it up to a receiver and get some speakers and your set. I have used this to play MP4 video files from a jump drive (32gb). No issues playing at all. The picture is bright and if used indoors you get a good picture during the day with just closed blinds. You can watch movies outside shortly after the sun sets.<br /><br />For a ceiling mount this fits it beautifully, and it super strong heavy metal.<br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H3S1LCR?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_dt_b_product_details<br /><br />For outdoor purposes I actually used the ceiling mount and connected it to a tripod.

4,Overall a good buy/Updated 1-04-2019,"Another update: As of 12/21/2017 Dudios has replaced my earbuds. If I would have read my user manuel a little closer maybe I would have had them a month or more earlier.  Page 11 says you can email support@dudios.com with details of problems. If I would have done that instead of just complaining on here where one of their reps happened across it. Well anyways They are solid on their warranty and I'm very pleased with the Dudios product.<br /><br />(old)Update: rubber cover over buttons developed a small bubble a couple weeks after I started using these. Now it is completely separated making the + button difficult to use.maybe I just got a bad one or may be a poor design.<br /><br />For the price a good set. Not as comfortable as the solid around the neck sets I've had in the past. The loose wire dose get in the way sometimes even whith the clips holding it to your shirt. I think the sound quality is pretty solid, again for the price. It's not equal to my Motorola headset that I paid $60 but it had built in graphic equaliser settings. Loved that headset till the right earbud quit working after a couple years. Anyway overall I like these, like some have said ear buds shaped a bit odd.

Sometimes the screen will rotate even if you have rotation turned off.  And sometimes it won’t connect to Wi-Fi, but connection issues decreased after turning off digital well being.  One digital well being was disabled, the tablet went from being bad to being average.  One thing that really irks me is the inability to remove most of the apps, some of which I’ll never use.  Some of these apps are google bloatware and some were the tablet company’s apps.  Also, the power and volume buttons should be a different color than the rest of the tablet shell, as it is hard to find them because they are hard to see.  You have to have a USB port or USB adapter to charge the tablet, as it comes with a USB cord with no plug.

I gave 4 stars instead of 5 only because adding a small “flip up clip” would make this wonderful little stand that much more fool proof.

I have always loved a great picture on any size t.v. and Samsung always delivers.

Keep the cover on the set until you put the legs on and set it on your table or wall- it will protect the screen. Set up was so easy- the directions are to the point. When you hook up your cable, dvd or blu-ray player with your HDMI cables, it recognizes every item, so when you turn on your t.v., all your hook-ups show up on the screen, allowing you to click on whatever you want to use for viewing.

2,Had To Buy Toshiba Portable Hard Drive- Disappointing,"When I first saw this Canvio ( Made by Toshiba) Wireless USB Adapter, I thought how great to be able to free up space on a Smartphone, Tablet, PC or Laptop by storing pictures, videos, music, documents, files and other documents on this. I read the compatibility statement to see if my Windows 7 would work, and yes it had Windows 7 listed along with Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Mac 05 x 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9.<br /><br />The directions were really simple- you just plug the AC Adapter into the wireless Canvio USB Adapter. Then you just plug the USB cable (Not included) into the Canvio and the other end into the external HDD. Next, you install the Canvio wireless adapter APP to a mobile device. Now you can run the APP.<br /><br />It all sounds so simple, until you realize that your Windows 7's portable hard drive is not supported or compatible with this Canvio wireless adapter, even though it says it is.  Then you read the fine, fine print, which states: Portable Hard Drive Sold Separately. Future compatibility of non-Toshiba portable hard drives may vary. Why couldn't Toshiba put this on the package front in LARGE writing? If I knew I had to buy a Toshiba Portable Hard Drive for another $65.00 plus a USB cable which is not included, I doubt I would have wanted this Wireless Adapter.<br /><br />Because Toshiba stated Windows 7 works with this adapter, yet failed to put in large print that it MAY NOT, I have to give this adapter 2 stars. The teensy print stating I MAY have to purchase a Toshiba portable Hard Drive at a $65.00 cost is just not up front enough for me. The adapter works great if you have a compatible portable Hard Drive or purchase a Toshiba one, but keeping the facts in such small print is just irritating to me, so I have to give it 2 Stars. (4 for a great product when you can actually hook it up and use it and 0 for hiding the facts in teensy print.)",B00J3HMY1E,B00J3HMY1E,AENQC6O3X4BUEQWSDTBUN2VMM5VQ,56:22.0,1,FALSE,1889,4.2,2,4
4,Peace Of Mind For A Mere $10!,"If you are having security issues and need actual photographs or proof of what is going on, this is not going to be of help to you. However, this Defender Imitation Dome Security Camera is so realistic that it is not only a great deterrent, but will bring you great peace of mind for only $10.00. Do these fake cameras work? ABSOLUTELY. At every place I worked, the owners used them. I worked at a Dry Cleaners who had a safe in the back. They had 2 security cameras and never had a robbery. One camera was real that didn't work and the other camera was an imitation. Both were mounted on the ceiling and you couldn't tell the two apart. Only if you held them in your hands could you see which was real and which was fake, as the real cameras are heavy. Another large cosmetic factory where I worked for years had employee problems. Working shoulder to shoulder on production lines all day caused tempers to flair on occasion, and sometimes someone would get their car egged or keyed, so to stop this problem, the company installed security cameras all around the parking lot. Needless to say, we never knew if the cameras were real or fake, but the car keying and egging magically stopped!<br /><br />This Defender Imitation Dome Security Camera looks exactly like the real thing. You could put this side by side with a real one and you would not know which was which on the ceiling. Only close up and in your hand will you feel the heavier real camera. This imitation camera comes with mounting equipment, as it is designed to be mounted on a ceiling and look down. I found it easier to install with string through the battery door and the string taped with heavy packing tape to an inside window frame, rather than drilling holes and screwing it in permanently, for a perfect view of our yard. This imitation camera is super light and can easily be held in place with simple string and tape. The battery compartment holds 3 AA batteries, which are supposed to last 3 months. Also, there is a one year guarantee, which means you can have a great LED flashing deterrent for only $10.00 a year and of course forever if you just use the dome without the flashing LED, should the LED finally fail.<br /><br />Another great thing is this camera can be mounted inside or outdoors. Since the unit is all plastic, it will stay perfect outside no matter what the weather. The flashing red LED light is wonderful- just like the real ones- it says the tape is filming you right now. Also included are 4 window warning stickers- just like the real ones come with, which is a nice touch for added security. Even if you need a real camera, you can also use these fakes for more security in combination with the real ones. No one ever knew at the Dry Cleaners where I worked for years that there was one real camera and one fake one side by side. It's just more added deterrents to help safeguard your property. If you want 24/7 protection- all cameras whether real or fake will always do the job, as after all, what crook is willing to take that chance of being photographed and this $10.00 Defender Imitation Dome will do just that!",B005INAVHQ,B005INAVHQ,AENQC6O3X4BUEQWSDTBUN2VMM5VQ,59:15.0,5,FALSE,3121,4.3,4,4

There is a tab on the battery cover which when shut holds the dongle in place. You can see in the reference photo I uploaded where the dongle is positioned as this is the correct storage spot. The arrow shows the tab that keeps dongle in place.<br /><br />Overall this mouse performance is so good and worth not having to spend 9 times more for a MX Master 3 model. The battery sleeps when not in use or you can shut off the mouse switch. The mouse wheel does not slip from your finger and makes it a good scrolling feature. I recommend getting one for value and comfort, it’s great!!",B09PHLXHMK,B09PHLXHMK,AHHQMVOQSY4WOIU5AWA5AEAQPJ6Q,45:04.7,0,FALSE,1162,4.1,5,4
5,Portable dock for adding two monitors,Great small desktop addition for when you need to add two monitors. Just plug in and play. You have the choice of using the included power supply or just use your laptops power. I tested it on a HP Pavilion laptop and it works flawless. The extra SD card ports are handy as well as having both USB 2 and 3.0 ports. I think most people use HDMI for monitors today but this device has one VGA port. You can only add 2 monitors at once whichever port configuration you choose.<br /><br />The ethernet port is available if you need it just by plugging the cable in. This is a fast hook up all the way around. The Tobenone designers did excellent work and hooray for them. We thank you!!,B097BVW4SF,B097BVW4SF,AHHQMVOQSY4WOIU5AWA5AEAQPJ6Q,57:19.2,1,FALSE,682,3.9,5,4

It does get a bit grainy the more you zoom in, but the picture quality is still fantastic for what it is. The night vision works just as well as the full color vision imo. The motion detector has caught everything so far and alerts me via the app on my phone. The sound quality is okay, it has a slight delay but definitely audible. I wish it could rotate 360 degrees like some other cameras of this caliber do but it’s great for setting up in the living room and seeing what my doggies are up to while I’m at work.

In effect camera became inoperational.<br /><br />Sent it to Olympus.  Got a letter back asking for [...] in repair costs. Called Olympus customer service.  Was told that they charge flat fee regardless of the problem.  Told them that this is ridiculous, its a wide-spread problem and Olympus should stand behind their product.  Car-manufacturers normally issue recalls or extend warranty for such problems. 5060 is not worth [...] I paid for it [...] a year and a half later.  Rep. went to speak with a manager and came back saying that ""Ah! If it is only the switch problem - then will charge you [...]"".  Apparently they did not even look at the camera before sending me the [...] bill.<br /><br />Needless to say the whole process took about a month.  Spent vacation with my 5 year old Canon Digital Elph.<br /><br />If you insist on buying Olympus - just be aware of the problem and that it is random and frequent and that Olympus does not handle it well.

I had even followed instructions to rinse them off after use.(and hung them by a fan to make sure they dried)  Even though they were about a month out of the year warranty, I emailed customer support, and they sent out a new pair.

5,Sturdy metal construction great sound and up to 32gig micro SD card(not included) storage.,"I purchased this recorder recently from Amazon as I wished for both Bluetooth connectivity and FLAC type recording. I was very familiar with this design recorder as I also own their fine DM-720 which uses the same NiMh battery type with USB charging and built-in USB plug. The info on Amazon is not quite correct as there is only one battery needed and included that being their proprietary 1.2v 750ma NiMh rechargeable battery. My older model also uses the same and both have long battery life. This LS-P4 also comes with a 5mm to 1/4-20 camera thread adapter if used on a tripod. The BT function was easily setup and paired with my Android app Audio ctrlBT Olympus App. Connection is fast and accurate however; if you chose any of the three recording formats PCM(wav),FLAC,or MPS, the remote app only has use of the PCM format and not the other formats.One other issue encountered with this fine recorder and by comparison to my Olympus DM-720 in similar design is the Red &#34;Record&#34; button. My only issue is that it does require a double press of this button in order to begin recording. The first press &#34;sets up&#34; the record for a quick visual of settings but, you must press it again to record. This process may catch you off guard in a fast record situation as you have to insure that the screen says &#34;record&#34;, and not &#34;pause&#34;. This is different as stated compared to many other makes and models when there is only a single press for record. Not an issue for me when I remember this fact.I have tested the remote app up to 30 feet,no problems and it works fine. Remember to disconnect the BT feature when done and to reset your format to FLAC or MP3 as it remains in PCM even after disconnecting from the remote app.",B0796FC97F,B0796FC97F,AHCTK423CB7DZFBZ7342JVBBICCA,40:46.9,24,TRUE,1751,3.3,5,3

The audio is clear in all ranges and neither too bright nor too muddy.<br /><br />These come with silicone and memory foam tips - I don't find either comfortable but I have small ears and always have that problem.  I use Blue cell replacement tips (small) and then these are ok.  They are lighter weight than the other active noise canceling units I have tried, so they do stay in my ear better and that also helps with the comfort.  The sound isolation is not great with the tips that come with the unit, but I find that to be somewhat personal and a function of the shape of your ear.<br /><br />There is a lot of noise transfer with these - when you move, the unit transmits a lot of crackling sound.  It doesn't matter if you have the noise canceling on or off.<br /><br />I haven't been in an environment where I can test the active noise canceling function yet, so I will update when I test that out.<br /><br />For those who don't know - earbuds (and for that matter headphones) can reduce noise in 2 ways - active and passive.  Passive noise reduction is often called sound isolation and this is based  on physically blocking the sound from getting into your ear.  Active noise reduction, often called noise canceling, works by the unit recording the ambient sound and essentially producing an opposite wave form to cancel out the sound.  Noise canceling works best with certain types of sounds - predictable, constant sounds (like jet engine noise) etc.  It does not work very well to reduce ambient conversation, for example, so if that is what you are looking for, you will be disapointed.",B004K09H32,B00WU0KVV6,AFPB3VF6UMRN2T6ZZGWPKEAFF75Q,27:25.0,1,TRUE,1773,4.4,3,4

Fintie is the only brand I remember the name of, because it is the best, in my opinion.  I got this folio case for my most recent tablet purchase.  This tablet was purchased to replace my not quite 2 year old Kindle Fire 10, which I managed to break (something I had never done before).  It had a non-Fintie cover, which didn't really protect my Kindle Fire 10, and was not in good shape.  As I recall, that case/cover was not much cheaper than the Fintie cases, but I had decided to give it a try as money was pretty tight, and I regretted that decision within a short time.  The quality just wasn't there - and ultimately, I had to replace my Kindle as a result.  I am extremely happy with this case.  It's beautiful to look at, and it's clearly better quality with more padding and a sturdier feel than the one I had on my other tablet.  There may be better folio cases out there, but I recommend Fintie - good quality, very attractive options, and they actually do protect that expensive tablet.",B08YQXYQ8Y,B08YNPQPR8,AHKYUXCHYAODSRMCD3ARJAAJI2GA,57:44.7,5,TRUE,1104,3.6,5,4

5,Audiophile quality at a budget price!,"I have two issues, and it is not with the IEM's themselves, but the company that sold them. First, the ones I purchased were originally returned. How do I know? Because whoever had them before me had worn them, and left ear wax on the silicone ear pieces. Luckily, they were not the size I wear so I made sure to wash all of the ones that came with the IEM's (included the dirty ones). And second, they went on sale two days after I bought them so I had to send an email to the seller to see if I can get the $10.00 off. UPDATE: 6/8/22 - Got the $10.00 discount!!<br /><br />Other than those two things, they are excellent IEM's! If you look at the frequency response of these, and realized that they are tuned, they're great for someone in the mid 50's. As you get older, you notice that your hearing loses higher frequencies. Pretty much every frequency above 12kHz are gone. These are tuned perfectly for someone who has lost those frequencies, and these start dropping off after 10kHz. So if you are younger, adjust the treble if you need to.<br /><br />How good are they? If you have ever heard Bruce Hornsby & The Range's song ""Every Little Kiss,"" you can hear Bruce shift his weight on the bench while playing his Steinway at the beginning of the song.<br /><br />So, if you love listening to music, and don't feel like forking hundreds of dollars for earbuds, these are the ones to buy.

I'm not a runner or a jogger.  I wear these sometimes on my bicycle and while doing chores around the house (yard work, auto detailing, home improvement etc).  They feel different than ear buds (heavier I guess) but they don't bother me when doing my activities.  Didn't like my download results with Itunes and WMP.  I ended up downloading my favorites off of RealPlayer.  The shuffle feature works fine for me. I don't need to search for particular songs or folders when listening.  Nor do I need a video screen. I had 600 or so favorites and they all downloaded so the capacity seems to exceed what is stated.  Everyone has their personal preferences and needs so I can see where this device wouldn't be for everyone, but it suits my needs just fine.

3,If not for the busy signal,"I really wanted to like these headphones, in fact generally do like them. They have great sound quality for the price I paid, which is quite cheap and I wasn’t expecting too much, but thought it was better than what I expected. The microphone isn’t great, most people said I sounded muffled, but this isn’t what I bought them for. The Bluetooth range was impressive. I left my phone downstairs and the signal was still strong upstairs. I almost would have kept them minus a pretty big problem that was not occurring the first few days of having these. No matter what I listen to, Spotify, an audiobook on kindle, pandora — a busy tone like when you call someone and there’s no voicemail but just a beeping tone interrupts my audio every two to three minutes. I didn’t realize this has FM capabilities, but it really only picked up one station but it was fuzzy (again not the reason I purchased the headphones). So if it wasn’t for this weird thing going on with the audio, I would have rated them higher. They’re cute, comfortable, I love the color, and the case it comes with but can’t seem to resolve this issue.",B07K5214NZ,B08K2S5B88,AGG5SOSJSW757LLYS6SM2F2BGEMQ,26:21.2,1,TRUE,1114,5.1,3,5

2,Works well for 9 -10 months only!!,"It worked well for 10 months or something. Then, first you will see minor problems like button for playing next song is not working. So for few months you will use phone to change song. You will feel its a minor fault and still be happy about it. Then, after few months around a year of buying, you will find now the volume is low. You will think, may be it was not charged well. Next time you charge well and viola volume is back to normal. Now after a year of buying, the volume will be permanently lower and the next song button not working. So, you will have to buy a new one now. Throw the junk, create more electronic garbage every year for lovely planet earth and again you are back to buying another one. May be they want to convey this is what you get in $30.<br /><br />Lesson: Good product if you want to put $30 every year. Or else buy a warranty and keep sending it back and forth. Basically, no peace for someone who wants to use only 1 hour of his day, 4 times a week during workout.

1,One of the worst.,"Worst board I've ever owned. Ran for about a year before becoming wildly unstable. Changing anything in terms of hardware would cause irrecoverable blue-screens. I've reinstalled windows 4 times in last 3 months due to inability to repair / diagnose. Tried everything I could think of and could find on the net. Last resort is always total wipe and re-installation - with laborious process of getting all my software to be configured  to run again.<br /><br />Plugging in USB device (like joystick, or vive, or bluetooth adapter) would cause this board to bluescreen on next reboot, lose raid, which for large part of the year was irrecoverable, but they updated it eventually to more stable. Noise in audio, default audio drivers result in clicking sounds and no actual audio. Yesterday I blue screened it after plugging in vive. I am out of patience with this brand. Had similar experience in 2011, had to RMA, will avoid MSI permanently from now on.",B00N2H1EAI,B00N2H1EAI,AFD7W65HLBUZVHQPLHAVCPR65TZA,49:49.0,1,FALSE,952,4.7,1,5
4,Almost great. But you should still buy it.,"It would be 5 stars, but its not - let me explain.<br /><br />The laptop itself is excellent. But there are two problems.<br /><br />1. There is diagonal screen tearing when running some apps on NVidia GPU. It is some asinine dispute between NVidia and Microsoft where they are blaming each other for something and neither is willing to fix it. If you run your browser on your NVidia GPU and try some WebGL demos/games/apps - you'll clearly see it. Some games suffer from this too. As do some 3D apps. Hope and pray they fix it in the future, because almost every laptop out there has this problem due to the same faulty componentry being used by most manufacturers. Sounds like its a software/driver issue or workaround however. This is still true as of this review, may be fixed in the future.<br /><br />2. Do not get anything but the lowest RAM/SSD config on this laptop. The laptop itself is excellent but the drives and ram it comes with are budget models HP is making money on. Get yourself a NICE SSD - and upgrade the 128GB one on this laptop. I got the M.2 960 Pro. Get yourself great ram too. Do not get anything but 128GB drive on this - total waste of money. The default 128GB drive on this laptop was giving me 150MB/s write speeds - while upgrade yields 3GB/s writes.<br /><br />The Good:<br />Great build quality despite being plastic.<br />- Easy to open and upgrade (use credit card to gently push the levers as you pry it open).<br />- Lightweight. Surprisingly lightweight for performance normally expected from Alienware like monoliths.<br />- Gorgeous screen. Scales great.<br />- GPU is good, will run mostly everything today at high or ultra settings at 1080P. Will choke running in 4k. I play SFV on this, runs maxed.<br />- Keyboard is very pleasant to use - I write code and its very satisfying to the touch.<br />- Touchpad is ok, not great, but ok. Clicks feel like they could be 50% more shallow.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get rid of the two ugly &#34;Intel Inside&#34; and &#34;NVidia GTX&#34; stickers. They will imprint into the plastic if you leave them on. Use pliers on the intel sticker (wtf intel?).",B01J8WZ1MW,B01J8WZ1MW,AFD7W65HLBUZVHQPLHAVCPR65TZA,35:51.0,28,TRUE,2146,2.4,4,2

3,"I underestimated what ""You get what you pay for"" meant.","It's just not very nice feeling.  You have to assemble the shoulder strap from two pieces, which is loosely held together with a buckle.  The pad flops straight to the bottom every time you pick it up and leaves you carrying bag uncomfortably on a twisted not very strong strap of leather.<br /><br />The leather itself is very thin, but that's the big problem.  It's the position of the straps.  The buckles you attach the strap to are positioned in such way that it scrunches the main flap.  When you pick up the bag, you're basically crinkling the sides with the metal buckles so it's constantly slightly folded.  Because the leather isn't very strong, over time this is definitely going to damage the bag more and more.<br /><br />The design of the bag itself is fine.  I wish they didn't use the belt buckle design for every single pocket, but it's okay.  18 inches is more than enough for everyday work.",B07PLJ7RF4,B07QHZSKPH,AHHMR6M4NFITRCYM73CUBNF6YXPA,14:35.5,0,TRUE,909,3.5,3,4

4,Great product!,"It fit my iPad 4th generation almost perfectly. It was a bit too tight where the top button is but it wasn’t a big issue. I noticed because the screen kept asking me to power off the iPad since the case was holding that button down due to it being a tad bit too fit. I simply solved that issue by shaving down some of the plastic in that area with a knife and the rubber piece covers it. Like I said, wasn’t a huge issue. I really like how it came with a screen protector!  I don’t use my iPad in any harsh or extreme situations so I haven’t got to experience the true level of protection that this case is said to provide.

2,Issues with excessive noises and one headrest clamp popping open,"Was very excited to get this since this is the only way to show and share video in my car based on the fact there is no place else to hold the ipad for two kids.  I installed the device which is very simple.  However 3 things.  1) I hate that it makes a rattling noise none stop and it also makes a squeaking noise.  I hear the rattling coming from the area where the base and the ball that allows it to swivel are connected.  The squeaking is coming from the clamp that locks the two sliding poles.  Of course I made sure everything is tight and then very tight.  My husband is actually the one that installed and is writing the review here.  The 2nd thing is the clamp at the far end keeps popping open or disconnecting if you will.  No matter how much I tighten the screw into that clamp it still pops open.  See image I attached. I think they should insert a little foam like rubber seal around the clamps as well so that when it is wrapped around the metal headrest poles it can help grip against the metal and keep from sliding. Sometimes one end slides upward due to the very lightweight ipad air 2 being on the mount. The 3rd item is the way you mount the ipad.  You need to use all the hands.  That is fine when using this in a larger vehicle but the back seats are not the size of SUV seats so I have to get all bent over and squeeze around the two child booster seats to work the ipad off the mount. When you try to push down on the ipad (ipad air 2) to get the spring loaded clamps at the bottom to move down so I can slide out the ipad, the entire mount slants downward.  I have these extra Natmounts which are magentic mounts for ipads and phones.  I wanted to mount that onto the ipad mount and use the magentic on and off release instead of the clamps.  Has anyone had similar problem as the 1st two I mentioned and any suggestions.  I have an infiniti Q50 red sport.",B00GUPPGSA,B07BKWT2VY,AGZMPJZR33MTXY7RZZFCI3JOJCFA,26:21.0,1,TRUE,1883,4.6,2,5

3,"Good things, some and challenging things too...","So, first off, for the price, the sound is great and the range is amazing!  I can walk 45 feet from my phone with these in my 1949 (thick walls) home and I still have reception.  But the battery life is funky.  You hold the side button on the right earbud to turn on and off, and a voice comes on and says ""power on"" or ""power off.""  Fine.  But I've found when I clearly turn them off, and I've charged them relatively soon beforehand, they still go dead very fast.  So it seems the ""power off"" really isn't turning it off, and it's draining battery life.  The red or blue light on the side of the right earbud tells you whether it's powered or not, and it's tiny--which is good overall, so there's not some annoying light coming from your ear if you're in a dark space or a library--so that's not the issue.  It just seems to drain battery charge, even when it's supposedly not on.  Upshot:  I'm always charging these things, which is a bit of a pain.  I need to start doing this the way I charge my computer--just plug them in every night.  So if you don't mind charging all the time, these are terrific.  And they STAY ON.  The wrap-around ear band is wet-noodle-y flexible, and once you get used to that, it's a terrific feature, because they don't bind or pinch.

4,It works. Mostly.,"This product is a very good choice if you want to transmit your Bluetooth-enabled phone to the speakers of your car. I use it for listening to music on long trips (Spotify), hands-free phone calls, and navigation.<br /><br />The GOgroove FlexSMART X3 is very good at finding empty or nearly empty radio frequencies. All the other functions are equally and literally push-button simple. I have to admit to the modest learning curve of identifying the chime of an incoming call and reaching for the GOgroove (and not my phone) to answer a call. But that's me, and no fault of the GOgroove.<br /><br />The one feature that clearly needs improvement is the sound level of phone calls, which is very low compared to the sound level of music or spoken navigation. When I accept a call, I have to turn up the sound level to twice what it was for the caller to be discernible on my car speakers. Once the call ends, I have to turn down the sound level right away or the continuation of music will be much too loud.<br /><br />One of the nice features of GOgroove is its ability to continue my music after I start my car. This is seamless most of the time, but it occasionally misses and I have to turn the GOgroove off and back on for it happen. I don't know if that's an issue with this product or my phone (or both), but this is quibble and no big deal to me.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very satisfied with this product and recommend it to anyone. In addition, to its functionality, its form factor is fairly svelte, and not as chunky as I thought it would be based on its photos.",B00BMYQTYE,B07CBSSNXG,AEN54LFS5AGZGBHSO45HKOBEX63A,14:04.0,0,TRUE,1574,4.8,4,5

5,Dynamic sounds and hardy product makes this a great purchase,"First, this is a great portable Bluetooth speaker. My previous speaker was an Oontz Angle 3, and this clearly blows it out of the water. JBL Flip 3 has amazing sound quality for music, movies, and audibles. It has proper sound dynamics and range, at least that I can tell, at both low and high volumes. The bass is great, but not phenomenal. I love that it is waterproof. Sometimes I let it hang on the edge of the bathtub where it'll get wet but it still works. The Bluetooth pairs quickly with my devices, and the range is decent, I'd say standard. Only star knock off is the inability to skip songs (but you can pause and play) and lack of real strong bass sounds.",B06VYFRFP1,B099V8GPR4,AEYUCH6VGHCAH2KWGSESEXBYYKBQ,10:09.0,0,TRUE,667,4.5,5,5
5,Best workout Bluetooth earbuds,"Here’s what I can tell you: I’m what my friends and family consider a gym rat, and I love to run.

The last pair I lost during a 12 hour commute home (they fell out of my bag somewhere) and I cried. Literally. I was exhausted and delirious, but I still cried.<br /><br />It comes with all the components to make Bluetooth earbuds worth it. Multiple types of squishy things? Got it. Charger? Got it! Container to keep them safe (which I clearly forgot to use)? Got it. It even comes with a sleeve you can adhesively add to the back of you phone case, and it works WONDERFULLY. I’ve always been in love with this brand and it comes so highly recommended. Will it stop when you take them out of your ears? No. But they will withstand all the sweat, the tears, the anxiety, anger, and everything else you throw at them that other brands can’t. You won’t be disappointed.<br /><br />Also, I have a long term dating relationship with an audio engineer who says that they’re not bad for their sound quality either. “Great for a bargain” were among the phrases used.",B01G8JO5F2,B01G8JO5F2,AEKPOCUIM66M2UGEK4EAMDYFI7TA,34:18.9,0,TRUE,1173,4.8,5,5

4,Decent enough for the money,"I'm using this as a helmet camera on my motorcycle. The image quality is decent enough, and it has a good field of view.<br /><br />I was looking for some sort of camera to stick on my helmet. It comes with plenty of adapters and mounting options in the box. They're all decent, but noticeably inferior to GoPro brand adapters. But they're free, so whatever. It comes with two cases, which you have to use if you want to mount it to anything. The sound quality upon playback is extremely quiet, and there's no way that I can find for an external mic to be connected. If there were, I'd rate this 5 stars. The image quality overall is great for a $50 gopro knockoff. No complaints there at all.<br /><br />My two major gripes with this are the battery life and the companion app. At 1080p 60 fps, it lasts maybe 45 minutes, and it only comes with two batteries, so I would advise against this if you plan on using it to shoot longer videos, or at least buy some extra or higher-capacity batteries to go along with it. The companion app also is garbage. This stems from two factors, mainly. Number one is that the app itself is poorly programmed. It's clear that the development team didn't really focus too much on the app, and more on the camera itself. The second is that the WiFi feature is that the camera puts out its own wifi signal that you have to manually connect to the first time to be able to easily manage anything on the camera. Why they couldn't have simply used bluetooth is beyond me. But I digress.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good alternative to a $800 gopro. It shoots great quality video for the money, but it's slightly lacking in other departments.",B01HGM33HG,B0771VF9TJ,AEDCX7JX7BSKCIG75AYTC7QMGFPA,21:18.6,2,TRUE,1672,4,4,4

5,Excellent Quality,"If you have the money to invest in this webcam, I highly suggest making the purchase. Logitech has a great reputation when it comes to the webcam sector. I have several webcams and this is now my favorite. Hopefully, this review helps with any decision you are trying to make.<br /><br />This is one of the few webcams that supports 4K Ultra HD 2160p/30fps. I just upgraded to a 4k monitor, so maybe most people are not looking for a 4K webcam.  At full HD 1080p/30 or 60 fps, this webcam also supports HD 720p/30, 60, or 90fps, it is still by far the best webcam I have right now. It is impressive! Even with makeup, you will probably notice a few flaws in your skin. It is that amazing!<br />It does come with a privacy shutter that you can attach if you want a physical block of the camera. Not only that, but it snaps on easily. There is also a black drawstring travel bag to prevent scratches and dust when not in use or if you need to travel with it. It does not come with a tripod, but it does have a tripod thread mount.<br /><br />There is a detachable mounting clip. I tested it on an older, bulky laptop. It is wide, and it worked great. I purchased a tripod because I will primarily use this for my desktop. I didn't like the idea of it hanging on my monitor, as it doesn't have a plastic outside edge. My monitor screen runs to the very edge. If you have a similar monitor, I would highly suggest purchasing a tripod. Another consideration that might make you want a tripod, this webcam can’t be tilted up or down or turned left or right, so it’s basically stuck in a fixed position. With the tripod I bought, the top half has a ball with the plate of the screw that attaches to the bottom of the webcam. This setup on the tripod allows me to adjust it to where I need it.<br /><br />This webcam is compatible with video conferencing platforms like Skype for Business, Microsoft Teams, Cisco, Cisco Webex, Cisco Jabber, Microsoft Cortana, Windows Hello, Skype, Google Hangouts, and other VC applications, XSplit, OBS, Twitch, BlueJeans, Zoom, Fuze, GoToMeetings, and Ring Central. I use several of these platforms and compared to my older 920 Logitech webcam, I can see a huge difference in quality. I share videos with colleagues, and they have also noticed a difference. As for the platforms, many have a maximum of 720p or 1080p. You probably won't notice a difference when joining a meeting.<br /><br />Once you start using the webcam, you will see the autofocus and the auto light correction with high dynamic range (HRD). It tracks movements and quickly makes the right adjustments. There are also three fields of view, so you are not limited to a single default. The three views are 65-degree, 78-degree, and 90-degree. If you are not familiar with what each would offer, the 65-degree view is a close-up view of your face, the 78-degree is more balanced with your face and some of the background, and the 90-degree view shows more of the background with you in the center.<br /><br />You also have omnidirectional microphones with noise-canceling to reduce background sounds to make the voice clear. It does not take away a cat meowing in the background, but I do notice less noise from my chair if I slightly spin.  I have not had any results where my voice is distorted, echoing, or that hollow sound. I think it helps to have two microphones built into this webcam. I want to mention, that the USB cable with this webcam is of high quality.

It feels like I got cheap accessories. Some might consider the price as a con, but I particularly do not. I feel the price matches the quality of this webcam and the features it does have.<br /><br />Tech:<br />Supported resolution: 4K/30fps; 1080p/30 or 60 fps; 720p/30, 60, or 90 fps<br />Diagonal field of view: 65 degrees, 78 degrees, 90 degrees<br />Focus type: Autofocus<br />Lens type: Glass<br />Built-in mic: Stereo-dual Omnidirectional, with 2 microphones<br />Dimensions: 1.06 inches high x 4.02 inches wide x 1.06 inches deep<br />Weight: 2.22 ounces<br />Cable Length: 7.2 feet",B01N5UOYC4,B0B7N8S4T5,AFE2FWMC7UY7FW54DZM6HDDMURUA,59:24.7,79,TRUE,4476,4.8,5,5
3,It works sometimes,"I seen these were 2 batteries and thought it was a great deal. It is a great deal of embarrassment when I am with a client. I have to take the battery out and put it in again, several times before it will work (see photo). Don't cut corners, buy the batteries from Nikon.<br />I have used both batteries a few times, purposely. Each time, I get my error. Battery life is alright but I do turn off my camera as I walk around the parks and gardens.<br />I gave 3 stars because once you get then to work, they do stay charged for awhile. I also would prefer a cord and charger head to plug into the wall to charge these. I have phones with c type chargers and of course required me to buy a charge cord to fit this.

Some of the features are a bit strange, e.g., the default is for the radio to turn off after 99 minutes unless the &#34;EXIT&#34; button is pressed immediately after turning the radio on.  I phoned and left a message on the company's support line to see if there was a way to change this so the default would be for the radio to stay on until manually turned off, but never got a call back.

We have purchased a 2100 Joule surge protector to replace the ineffective 600 Joule unit that was on the system.  Oops.<br /><br />Rather than replace the TV, we decided to try an HDMI to composite converter.  The converter worked with both HDMI components individually.  In an effort to avoid buying a second converter, we bought this switch.  The switch worked well to transmit the video images, but a significant audio hiss was introduced.  We had no issues with the audio before and all system components (TV, receiver, cable box, power supplies, ...) are on the same grounded power supply, so it's probably something in the switch.

5,Great for Zoom and Team meetings,"Got these to replace the 'mickey mouse' ear style of head phones.  I use these for both Zoom and Teams meetings. AT least for my setup, the head phones need to be turned on before starting either Zoom or Teams, but may be different for someone else. Sound is good and work good for my purpose. These do seem to work better when listening to someone with an accent. When using for Zoom, you do have to select the head phone within the Zoom settings, but for everything else, can be selected in the Windows settings. These are very light and I really like the mobility since this uses Bluetooth. I can go about 30 feet before reception starts breaking up, which means I can get another cup of coffee during morning meetings. Haven't tried these for music yet, so can't say how these sound for that application. Battery life is good - can easily go 4 hours and still be at medium charge. I do keep these charged throughout the day and charging is fast. For long meetings (over an hour) these do put a little pressure at the contact point of your head, but just moving them slightly to another position can relieve that. You will feel  vibration from someone talking loud (and probably heave bass from music), but that should be expected since these are a bone induction head phone. But during normal conversation, there is very little vibration - almost negligible. Would recommend as a good replacement for the standard head phones.",B08BZDR3ZT,B08BZDR3ZT,AGYLNVMXHCNI5JD5L4UGHFBY5SDQ,59:48.5,0,TRUE,1430,4.2,5,4

Using the modeled amps I can dial in many different and pleasing tones, and the loudspeaker reproduces them beautifully. Many of us have tried amp after amp with modeled amps and came away disappointed. If that description fits, try this loudspeaker. It's about as close to the holy grail as we're going to get!<br /><br />My current setup includes a Boss GP-10 and GR-55 which sound great through the PA speaker (actually sound very good through the Peavey KB amp as well). I also run Digitech and Line 6 boxes through it and they all sound great.<br /><br />I use the speaker with electric guitars, nylon guitars, and vocals. Could not be happier.<br /><br />Plus the speaker is light and easy to handle, great power, just a great buy, especially for what I paid for it (I noticed soon after the purchase the price jumped significantly).",B005FUWTJU,B005FUWTJU,AHOPM2RGN6VXHKOR2NCYQ6EGTAYQ,19:54.0,2,TRUE,1174,4.4,5,4

1,Had high hopes,"This camera has less view angle than the original Yi Camera. That just means it has to scan a little more often.

However, the worst part is as it's moving to track an object, it interrupts the audio recording as it picks itself up and ruins the audio. This is a deal breaker.<br /><br />**Update** Ended up returning it and changing to a 1. Yes the camera can rotate 360 degrees but when you only need about a hundred and sixty degrees rotation there's no way to stop it from spinning backwards and staring at the wall. I tried setting bookmarks and other aspects it's still recorded the wall for two solid days.

That will leave me with plenty of room for a few personal items.  The bag appears to be well constructed and durable. It's well padded and includes four Velcro-locking dividers.  My only complaint, so far, is that the zipper track is made of some kind of plastic material with dual metal pull tabs.

My setup consists of a 51&#34; Samsung plasma TV, Vizio Soundbar, Roku and a Windows 7 HTPC with two OTA tuners running Windows Media Center. The Companion works great controlling everything, but because it works with the HTPC over bluetooth, it can't wake it from sleep.<br /><br />I ordered the FLIRC hoping to figure a way to get it to work with the Harmony to add the wake from sleep to my power on sequence. It turned out to be super simple and is working perfectly.<br /><br />I downloaded the software and driver from the FLIRC website and installed on my HTPC. I plugged in the FLIRC to a front USB port and Windows loaded the driver. There was a firmware update available and the FLIRC software prompted me to update which I did. I then selected the WMC MCE remote profile in the FLIRC software and selected the &#34;Start&#34; button that displayed on the image of that remote and then pressed the power on sequence button on my Harmony Companion remote. The software recorded that key press and saved it.

1,Simple: AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!,"I have never given a review like this before, but this product inspired me. I had to send the first one back for a high frequency noise coming from the unit.

5,So worth the money.,This is an amazing little radio. Great tone and reception. Would also be handy to take to the beach and on other outings. Glad l chose this one from the various ones available.

4,UPDATE: Performing better,"This system replaced the Arlo Pro 2--returned it because the batteries would not charge.<br />I bought a security camera because I wanted to ID the person who was causing damage in my front yard, and although these camera's setup was easy, video quality is clear and there is no monthly fee, my experience is that they are not dependable in detecting humans (disclosure: they did detect people maybe three times).<br />Installed them last Saturday and I emailed support the following day and have been emailing back and forth. The main issue is that persons are NOT detected even when the motion detection is set to ""all motions"" and on highest ""detection sensitivity"".<br />Customer support asked me to change an option on my cell (turned Power saving off), send them a log, videos (with exact times when detection SHOULD have occurred), etc. Still today, July 28, cameras are not detecting humans--tested walking (about 10-25 feet in front and on side of cameras this morning w/""humans only"" w/highest detection sensitivity--and no detection, no alerts.<br />I am disappointed and at a lost; i need a dependable security system, so, I'll keep researching. Hopefully, will update this post.<br />UPDATE:JUL30 - Cameras are detecting better--picking up people more. After calling the support folks at eufy (short wait time--~4 minutes) found out that detection depends on the angle (down tilt of about 25 degrees) of the camera. I have not mounted as of yet--testing it out; just in case i had to return them. I also had trouble enabling the LED Status button (in the app)-it was greyed out; after talking to support i was instructed to tap hard on the button--and poof, the dialog box popped up and enabled it.<br />I will update review once cameras are mounted--once up, I can experiment with the ""sensitivity level"". As long as i can reach out to support (via email-response turnaround is 24 hours; via phone you can call btwn 8-7PM Central), I am more at ease and confident that issues can be resolved and becoming more confident in the product.<br />Dec2021: cameras mounted for 3 / 4 mos. Does not detect 100% of the time; support recommended changing location  and/or angle. Will play around with that in warmer months. For price, still a good buy.",B07X5W6QB1,B0C14L1HPS,AH2MFSWWORO4GUECH44AB263I3EA,34:06.5,1,TRUE,2255,3.1,4,3
5,Excellent speaker for ham radio transceiver,"I bought this as an external speaker for my transceiver, a Yaesu FTDX3000 because the matching speaker from Yaesu costs about $200.  The transceiver has about 3 watts audio output at 8 ohms, which is sufficient to drive the speaker to a good listenable volume.  It is much better than the internal speaker in the transceiver and about equal to the quality of the Koss headphones I also use with it.  Keep in mind the transceiver does not put out audiophile quality sound, so I don't know what these would do with a good stereo receiver.  But for my purpose, it was fine and I cant imagine that the $200 Yaesu matching speaker is any better.  The black finish of the speaker was a good cosmetic match to the finish of the transceiver, and its height is close to the height of the transceiver (needs some silicone feet to bring it up to the height of the transceiver) so it looks nice too.  Only problem is I have a spare speaker now!",B00N8265I8,B00N8265I8,AHT5MQ7XNHXH7XIBTNF6RGNFCCFQ,43:42.1,0,TRUE,932,1.1,5,1

5,"Very beautiful lens, for the money","The optics on this lens seem really good to me, but I'm not one of those lens analysis people. The aperture ring is not ""clicky"", which is fine by me. The aperture and focus rings are really smooth and not stiff, but also not too ""un-stiff"".<br /><br />The ""look"" of the lens is really nice, and I usually don't care about that at all. The nice white markings are a little large, but in a very stylish way, and the depth-of-field graph gives it a superb retro look.<br /><br />If I were to complain about something, it would be that the aperture ring above f4 doesn't have much detail, it's basically ""something tighter than f4"". That doesn't bother me, but if you want to precisely dial-in f11 you might be frustrated.<br /><br />Very solid construction, like the other 7Artisans lenses I have, like the very different-looking 35mm f1.2 (also a super-nice lens, for the money).",B08LDG5VJB,B0BYN8TQ46,AELYRFESENGFWEMJCWQYFTVFYZUA,26:52.3,0,TRUE,878,4.3,5,4
3,Works when it works. Form factor could be a lot better,"The ""battery"" part (the dummy that plugs into the camera battery compartment) is *slightly* smaller than an actual compatible battery. What that means is that when the little orange clip in the camera ""grabs"" that part, it may or may not make contact with the camera electronics. Also, that dummy battery weighs almost nothing, which is nice in some ways but it would be better if it had at least a little heft to it. When it makes contact successfully with the camera, it does work great however. I've had it going for long periods of time without any heating problems or anything like that; the actual transformer is not in the dummy part.",B08FRB25HX,B08FRB25HX,AELYRFESENGFWEMJCWQYFTVFYZUA,12:19.3,0,TRUE,641,5,3,5

5,Portable is good,"I like two things about this antenna and that is I can move it around and it works great. I installed this on my Bose wave 3 music system and it gave me one more station than I was getting without it but that's all I expected out of it because all the other stations are way too far away from my house to even think about bringing them in. ""I live in a valley with mountains on all 4 sides of my house."" The local station I was getting without this antenna stops playing music every evening at 6pm. After installing this antenna, I can pick up one more station that is about 40 miles from my home. It plays country music 24-7 so I'm happy now. I can move this antenna around when I need to. I like that a lot about it because the airwaves move some from night time to day time for some reason where I live.",B09B9HHCYL,B09B9HHCYL,AEL37U6KOJJ6P7W6M7CTLUOTEXWA,11:41.9,0,TRUE,806,2.9,5,3
